# Now Assist release notes

The ServiceNow® Now Assist experience brings generative AI to your organization. You can improve productivity and efficiency by delivering better self-service, recommending actions, delivering answers, and providing your users with AI Search. Now Assist was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Now Assist highlights for the Australia release

[Australia Patch 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-3.md)

-   Now Assist Guardian is enabled by default and detects prompt injection attempts and offensive content without manual activation.
-   Configure prompt injection detection separately for each Now Assist skill.
-   Create knowledge articles from Now Assist using files stored in Box.
-   Improve the clarity and accessibility of your articles with the AI-powered prompt Reading Ease scan.

-   **[Merge duplicate articles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/merge-duplicate-articles.md)**

    Merge selected duplicate knowledge articles into a new consolidated article using Now Assist in Knowledge Management. The merge preserves references to source articles and helps maintain a clean, high‑quality knowledge base.


**Important:** Now Assist is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## Important information for upgrading Now Assist to Australia

If you customized actions on the user interface or other items that are associated with Now Assist skills, confirm that your customized code is updated with the new skill releases. Otherwise, certain functions might not work as expected.

If you run into issues when you're upgrading a Now Assist product, see the [Issues and mitigation for Now Assist \(generative AI\) Applications and Plugin updates \[KB1637452\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1637452) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Log in to view the article.

The Australia release introduces enhanced protections for read‑only fields across the ServiceNow AI Platform. These changes include a new read\_only\_option field with granular control levels, including strict\_read\_only and client\_script\_modifiable. The changes occur in the back end and maintain backward‑compatible behavior. This update helps strengthen instance security while preserving flexibility. If you have custom client scripts that modify read‑only fields using `g_form.setValue()` or `g_form.clearValue()`, refer to the [KB2718122](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2718122) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base to identify affected fields and adjust the settings.

The existing access control lists \(ACLs\) have been updated to replace the admin role with purpose-driven granular roles within scripts or security attributes. As part of this update, the `getRoles()` API is replaced with the `hasRole()` API for authorization purposes. Additionally, all references to the admin role in the code have been substituted with the granular roles for authorization use cases. For more information, see [Granular admin roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/granular-admin-roles.md).

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Prompt library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/conversational-interfaces/now-assist-prompt-library.md)**

    Browse and select from promoted prompt templates or save your own custom prompts, eliminating the need to retype frequently-used prompts within your chats. Access your reusable templates instantly from the omnibar for faster, more consistent conversations.


-   **[Create knowledge articles using Now Assist and Box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/kc-create-article-with-Box.md)**

    The Knowledge Center now integrates with Box. This integration enables authors to use stored files as a source for generating knowledge articles with Now Assist.

-   **[Post-chat surveys](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-panel-premium.md)**

    Collect user feedback in Now Assist panel premium chat through post-chat surveys that trigger on agent task completion instead of waiting for a chat-end event. When an agent completes a task in an agentic flow, the survey can surface based on a configured probability, enabling you to gather insights that were previously unavailable.

-   **[Now Assist Guardian enabled by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/now-assist-guardian.md)**

    Detect and log prompt injection attempts across all generative AI applications and features, and offensive content in supported Now Assist skills, by default. You can configure Now Assist Guardian to block AI-generated responses when an attempt is detected.

-   **[Using Now Assist Admin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/using-now-assist-admin_0.md)**

    Explore additional user interface tabs of a Now Assist skill within a selected workflow. Access the usage and analytics of that skill. You can also view and manage the security and governance details of the selected skills.

-   **[Create knowledge articles using Now Assist and Box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/kc-create-article-with-Box.md)**

    Knowledge Center integrates with **Box**, enabling authors to use stored files as a source for generating knowledge articles with Now Assist.

-   **[Article Optimization with Reading Ease scan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/kc-reading-ease-scan.md)**

    The AI-based **Reading Ease** scan, integrated into the article optimization feature of Knowledge Center, scans articles for readability, provides actionable recommendations, and supports ongoing article improvement.

-   **[Configure prompt injection detection for Now Assist skills](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/configure-prompt-injection-attack-protection.md)**

    Set the prompt injection detection action and severity level for Now Assist skills. Prompt injection detection is enabled by default for all Now Assist skills, except Platform skills and custom skills. When a skill has its own setting, Now Assist Guardian automatically applies the more protective of the two settings, the skill-level setting or the instance-level setting.

-   **[Visual Q&amp;A in Now Assist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-qa-genius-result.md)**

    Upload screenshots, error images, or documents in the Now Assist panel and get AI-generated answers about content without leaving your current context.

-   **[Catalog experience](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-panel-premium.md)**

    Navigate away from a catalog form mid-completion and a modal appears asking whether you want to stay or leave, preventing accidental loss of your work. After you submit a catalog item, you can select View Details to open the submitted record.

-   **[Enhancements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-panel-premium.md)**

    Switch between multiple interactive views — such as knowledge articles, catalogs, and org charts — within a single conversation using a new dropdown in the Now Assist panel. When more than six promoted topics are available, you can select a category on the topic menu to see all of them at once.

-   **[Image and document upload](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-panel-premium.md)**

    Upload images and screenshots directly into the Now Assist panel as part of your conversation and the Now Assist interprets the visual content to answer your questions or generate summaries.

-   **[Maintain and display the right context](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-panel-premium.md)**

    Open the Now Assist panel while working on an incident record and you automatically see the most recent conversation tied to that incident. You can continue chatting about the incident or switch to unrelated topics in the same session, keeping your work in context without losing your place.

-   **[Using Now Assist Admin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/using-now-assist-admin_0.md)**

    Explore the archive option from navigation pane within Now Assist Admin and archive custom and copies of Now Assist skills.


-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md)**

    The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you an AI native experience with three licensing tiers available:

    -   Foundation: AI agents and skills to deliver insights
    -   Advanced: AI agents and skills to boost productivity across relevant use cases
    -   Prime: Act autonomously with all AI agents and skills, and create your own
-   **[Merge duplicate articles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/merge-duplicate-articles.md)**

    Use Now Assist in Knowledge Management to merge selected duplicate knowledge articles into a single consolidated article, preserving references to the original sources and maintaining a high‑quality, well‑organized knowledge base.


## Changed in this release

-   **[Now Assist Conversational Help](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/conversational-help-skills.md)**

    The discovery of Conversational Help Skills from the Now Assist panel is no longer configured as auto-enabled.

-   **[Default model provider updated to third-party LLM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md)**

    The Now LLM Service is no longer the default model provider for new or inactive AI assets. A third-party LLM is now selected by default, while existing configurations using the Now LLM Service continue unchanged. The Now LLM Service is still available for manual selection.


## Deprecated features
