## About Accounts Payable Operations

Now Assist introduced AI on the platform. As that experience has evolved, there's a new name for the experience. ServiceNow Otto® is the conversational AI platform integrated into ServiceNow workflows. It provides agentic capabilities, supports multimodal interactions across web, mobile, and messaging channels, and enables autonomous orchestration for cross-system workflows.

-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md)**

    The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you an AI native experience with three licensing tiers available:

    -   Foundation: AI basics to deliver insights
    -   Advanced: AI to boost productivity across relevant use cases
    -   Prime: Act autonomously with all AI assets, and create your own
    Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents.


-   Invoice tax lines now capture the jurisdiction, jurisdiction type, and tax authority applied during tax calculation.
-   Suppliers can submit, track, and confirm resolutions without portal navigation.
-   Configure rejection modes to customize workflows so that AI workers focus on resolution quality rather than administrative tasks.
-   Use automated email parsing and LLM-assisted responses to handle cases with less manual effort.

## Australia

The ServiceNow® Accounts Payable Operations application adds capabilities for supplier case resolution and confirmation workflows. The large language model \(LLM\)-aided email parser agent automatically classifies incoming supplier inquiries, eliminating manual intervention and routes invoice inquiry cases to the appropriate teams. Invoice exceptions in Accounts Payable Operations are enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Tax engine integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/tax-engine-integration.md)**

    The tax engine integration framework validates supplier-provided tax against system tax at invoice line level, and supports regional and global tax requirements. This integration triggers automatic tax validation, handles exceptions for tax variance and missing data, enables manual re validation and rolling up of system tax.

-   **[Email parser agent for APO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/email-parser-agent-for-apo.md)**

    The email parser agent is an AI agent that automatically processes incoming emails \(Level 1 support cases and tasks\) from suppliers and invoice owners. The email parser agent identifies actionable requests, classifies them, and creates invoice cases.


-   **[Invoice rejection modes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/invoice-rejection-modes.md)**

    APO supports configurable rejection modes for invoice exception handling. Administrators can configure rejection mode behavior per exception type to align with organizational policies and audit requirements.


### What's deprecated or removed

-   Roll up logic applies only to system tax, not to supplier-declared tax. Supplier tax roll up is removed. This replaces the previous approach, which lacked independent validation of supplier-provided tax amounts.

### Plugin information

-   **New plugins**

    The following plugins are new in Australia:

    Tax Engine Integration with Vertex \(com.sn\_fsc\_vertex\): This plugin enables the integration of APO with Vertex \(vendor\) to perform tax validation on invoices resulting in tax accuracy and compliance.
