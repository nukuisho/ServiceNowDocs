# Project Workspace release notes

The ServiceNow® Project Workspace application provides an intuitive user experience that enables project managers to plan and manage their projects. Project Workspace was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Project Workspace highlights for the Australia release

[Australia Patch 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-4.md)

-   Support added for third-party AI models: GPT-5.4 mini and Gemini 3.5 Flash
-   Third-party AI models are the default models for all Now Assist for SPM skills.
-   The Now LLM Service is no longer the default model provider for new or inactive AI assets. A third-party LLM is now selected by default, while existing configurations using the Now LLM Service continue unchanged. The Now LLM Service is still available for manual selection.

[Australia Patch 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-1.md)

-   Enable tracking of the hardware requests that are part of a Strategic Portfolio Management \(SPM\) project.
-   View, assign, and approve resources directly from the Resources page in Project Workspace without navigating to the Resource Management Workspace.
-   Deliver clear, executive‑ready project status reports using AI.
-   Use the AI insights page to view task, milestone, resource, financial, and RIDAC \(risks, issues, decisions, actions, and change requests\) insights for a project.
-   Configure project types with custom fields and form views to support configuration independence across different project types within the same SPM instance.
-   Add inline comments and @mention colleagues in Docs and receive email notifications for replies and mentions.

See [Project Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/project-workspace-landing-page.md) for more information.

**Important:** Project Workspace is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

-   **[Project types and project enhancements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/project-types-in-pw.md)**

    Configure project types with custom fields and tailored form views across different types of projects.

    -   Use a dynamic category to define custom fields for a specific project type. Custom fields are scoped to that project type and don't appear on records of other types or affect default fields.

You can comment on plain text, hyperlinks, dynamic data, and text inside table cells, and track discussions through threads, all without leaving the page or switching applications.

    Email notifications with comment details, document name, workspace name, and document path are sent when a reply is added to your comment or when you're @-mentioned. Each notification includes a button that opens the document and navigates directly to the comment. Edit or delete your comments and choose to show or hide comment highlights. Users with read-only access can add comments and participate in comment threads.

-   **[Project plan generation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/generate-projects-using-nowassist.md)**

    Identify and assign the best-fit resources to unassigned task assignments using generative AI, which analyzes resource data and generates a fit score and rationale for each available resource based on skills and availability for the task time period. Compare fit scores, AI rationale, and availability for each resource, then confirm the assignment when ready.

-   **[Expanded project insights topics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/configure-project-insights-generation-skill.md)**

    -   Budget fluctuations: Monitors budget changes and highlights significant variances for review.

    Create AI status reports from an existing template using the Generate from template. Add dynamic tokens to your template to display AI-generated field data in the report document.
