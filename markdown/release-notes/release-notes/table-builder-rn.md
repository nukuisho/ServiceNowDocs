# Table Builder release notes

The ServiceNow® Table Builder application is a centralized way to build tables, forms, and display logic. Table Builder was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## About Table Builder

[Australia Patch 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-5.md)

-   ServiceNow Otto® is the new AI experience brand. This change is reflected in the name of ServiceNow products. Your product entitlements remain unchanged. Check your entitlements to determine your access to specific features.
-   Starting with the Australia release, Form Designer is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer available for activation but will continue to be supported. Features within Form Designer will be available in the Form Builder.

-   Read-only behavior is now controlled by the **Read only option** \[`read_only_option`\] choice field, which provides options such as **Display Read Only** or **Strict Read Only**.
-   The existing **Read only** field will no longer be editable in the UI.

See  for more information.

## Australia

The ServiceNow® Table Builder application is a centralized way to build tables, forms, and display logic. Table Builder was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's changed

-   ****

    A new **Read Only Option** has been added to the dictionary tables \(`sys_dictionary` and `sys_dictionary_override`\). The existing **read\_only** field is now locked and cannot be edited in the UI. Field behavior depends on the selected option. With **Display Read Only**, the field appears read-only but can still be updated through APIs. With **Strict Read Only**, the field can't be changed in the UI or by client scripts such as \[`g_form.setValue()`\]. A new system property,`glide.read_only.legacy_read_only_behavior`, controls whether the old behavior, where client scripts could override read-only settings, is retained.
