## New in the Australia release

-   **[Real-time AI assistance for voice interactions using Live Agent Assist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/add-gd-input-output-playbook.md)**

    Live Agent Assist for Voice provides real-time AI assistance to agents during live voice interactions in Agent Workspace. As conversations unfold, it returns answers drawn from the live call transcript and customer context sources such as the Customer Context Builder, knowledge articles, and the Enterprise Knowledge Graph. Agents receive timely suggestions, which reduces handling time and improves first-contact resolution.

-   **[Add a playbook as an action type in Recommended Actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/add-gd-input-output-playbook.md)**

    As an Admin, you can configure playbooks as an action type in Recommended Actions, and the Recommended Actions rule engine recommends the right playbook based on context. Playbooks surface inline as cards in the Recommended Actions panel in Agent Workspace and walk Agents through branching decision trees for support, sales, and troubleshooting scenarios. Embedded actions such as creating a task or triggering a workflow can be executed from within the playbook in the Recommended Actions panel in Agent Workspace.

-   **[Now Assist for CSM Major Issue Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/configure-na-for-csm-major-issue-management.md)**

    Use AI to proactively detect emerging issues from case patterns and automatically propose major cases when similar cases trend together. The system monitors recent cases for correlated patterns across the product model hierarchy, and when it identifies a developing issue that no existing major case covers, it proposes a case as a major case candidate for review. Major issue managers gain earlier visibility into developing case patterns and can escalate to major case status faster, reducing the time customers experience disruption.

-   **[Now Assist for CSM- Case insights section](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/now-assist-csm-summarize-case.md)**

    Resolve cases faster with a new case insights section that brings together key case details, customer summary, issue history, sentiment scores, and special handling notes in one consolidated view.

-   **[Customer Service Management AI agent collection- Voice-driven case status retrieval and updates:](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/voice-ai-agent.md)**

    Reduce live agent dependency by enabling customers to check open case statuses and submit case updates through guided voice interactions across Genesys, Twilio, NICE, Five9, 3CLogic, and Amazon Connect CCaaS platforms.

-   **[Customer sentiment analysis on email interaction page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/analyze-sentiments-in-now-assist-for-csm.md)**

    View automated sentiment scores and trends from conversation directly on the email interaction page in Now Assist for CSM, The system reads customer emails and gives a score to show how the customer is feeling, so agents and managers can quickly check the customer's mood without reading the whole conversation.

-   **[Now Assist for CSM Case Playbook for Complaints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/accelerate-complaint-case-handling.md)**

    Replaced the Agent Assist tab in the side panel with a Recommended Actions tab.

    Automatically evaluate agent activity on closed cases using AI models that score each interaction against a configurable quality rubric, eliminating manual sampling and ensuring consistent, objective assessments at scale.

-   **[Now Assist for CSM-Extended table support for email reply recommendation skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/configure-extended-table-support-for-the-email-reply-recommendation-skill.md)**
