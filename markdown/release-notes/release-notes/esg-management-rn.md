# Operational Sustainability Management \(formerly Environmental, Social, and Governance\) release notes

The ServiceNow® Operational Sustainability Management application \(formerly known as Environmental, Social, and Governance Management\) manages sustainability-related data, metrics, and reporting requirements. Operational Sustainability Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Operational Sustainability Management highlights for the Australia release

-   Edit calculated metric definition formulas after execution and apply updated formulas from a specific date, preserving historical data integrity with formula versioning.
-   The Microsoft 365 reporting add-in and the Document designer add-in are consolidated into a single Document designer plugin for streamlined sustainability reporting.
-   Use the AI reporting assistant in Document designer to generate report content from ServiceNow data using prompts directly within Microsoft Word.
-   Map Operational Sustainability Management roles to Risk Library and Compliance Library feature roles to control access to risk and compliance data based on functional domains.
-   Perform CSRD-compliant double materiality assessments in Socialsuite and automatically sync the results with the Operational Sustainability Management application.

See [Operational Sustainability Management \(formerly Environmental, Social, and Governance\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/esg-landing-page.md) for more information.

**Important:** Operational Sustainability Management is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Edit a calculated metric definition formula](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/edit-a-calculated-metric-definition-formula.md)**

    After upgrading GRC: Metrics to version 22.3.1, you can edit a calculated metric definition formula after it has been executed. When you save an edited formula, select a date from which the updated formula applies. Each saved edit creates a new formula version.

-   ****

    After upgrading Document Designer to version 22.3.2, the Microsoft 365 reporting and Document Designer add-ins are consolidated into a single Document Designer plugin. A Create Claim button is added to the manifest. The repeater limit per document increases from 2 to 5, and the repetition limit per repeater increases from 200 to 500.

-   ****

    With AI for Document Designer, you can use the AI reporting assistant to generate report content from ServiceNow data using prompts directly within Microsoft Word. The assistant inserts the output into your document as stories, tables, charts, or data points.

-   **[Components installed with Operational Sustainability Management \(formerly ESG Management\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/components-installed-with-esg.md)**

    After upgrading Operational Sustainability Management to version 22.3.1, Operational Sustainability Management roles are mapped to Risk Library and Compliance Library feature roles to enforce functional domain separation. Users assigned these roles can access only risk and compliance records tagged to the functional domains they are authorized for.

-   **[Document intelligence for utility invoices](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/ai-driven-document-intelligence-for-utility-invoices.md)**

    After upgrading Now Assist for Operational Sustainability Management to version 22.0.1, unit values from invoices and updates metric data are extracted automatically, reducing manual data entry and improving data accuracy.

-   **[Integrating Operational Sustainability Management with Socialsuite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/integrate-operational-sustainability-with-SocialSuite.md)**

    After upgrading Operational Sustainability Management to version 22.0.1, streamline sustainability reporting and compliance processes by conducting CSRD-compliant double materiality assessments in Socialsuite and automatically syncing the results with Operational Sustainability Management. This integration supports impact and financial materiality assessments following Global Reporting Initiative \(GRI\) and European Sustainability Reporting Standards \(ESRS\) standards.

-   **[Create a threshold for a metric](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/create-a-threshold-for-a-metric.md)**

    After upgrading Operational Sustainability Management to version 22.0.1, you can configure thresholds with multiple levels and ranges for granular monitoring. When thresholds are breached, automated actions trigger immediately.


## Changed in this release

-   ****

    After upgrading Operational Sustainability Management to version 22.3.1, role inheritance is updated to restrict access only to the resources required for each role. These changes apply to new installations only.

    -   The connection\_admin role is removed from sn\_esg.integration\_admin inheritance.
    -   The workspace\_user role is removed from Formula Builder configuration table access and from sn\_esg.reader and sn\_esg.data\_owner inheritance.
    -   The sn\_align\_core.ap\_read\_only role in sn\_esg.reader is replaced with sn\_ppm.reader.

-   ****

    After upgrading Operational Sustainability Management to version 22.3.2, the Business domain field in the Template configuration and Data relationship tables now references the GRC business domain \(sn\_grc\_business\_domain\). Previously, these fields referenced the M365 business domain.


-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md)**
