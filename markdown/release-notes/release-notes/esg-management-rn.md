# Operational Sustainability Management \(formerly Environmental, Social, and Governance\) release notes

The ServiceNow® Operational Sustainability Management application \(formerly known as Environmental, Social, and Governance Management\) manages sustainability-related data, metrics, and reporting requirements. Operational Sustainability Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## About Operational Sustainability Management \(formerly Environmental, Social, and Governance\)

-   ServiceNow Otto is the new name for the Now Assist experience in Operational Sustainability Management. All Now Assist references have been updated to ServiceNow Otto.
-   You can group manual, calculated, and automated metrics into a campaign by entity, group, or both. When bulk actions are enabled, you can move an entire campaign through its lifecycle as a single unit, instead of tracking each metric independently.
-   Set a variance base value for a metric, so percentage-based threshold calculations stay meaningful even without prior-period data or if the previous value is zero.
-   Edit calculated metric definition formulas after execution and apply updated formulas from a specific date, preserving historical data integrity with formula versioning.
-   Use the AI reporting assistant in Document designer to generate report content from ServiceNow data using prompts directly within Microsoft Word.
-   Perform CSRD-compliant double materiality assessments in Socialsuite and automatically sync the results with the Operational Sustainability Management application.

## August 2026

The ServiceNow® Operational Sustainability Management application \(formerly known as Environmental, Social, and Governance Management\) manages sustainability-related data, metrics, and reporting requirements. Operational Sustainability Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Campaigns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/environmental-social-governance/campaigns.md)**

    After upgrading GRC: Metrics to version 22.5.2, you can group manual, calculated, and automated metrics into a campaign by entity, by group, or both. The unique combination of Group, Frequency, Calendar type, and Entity defines each campaign's metric set. When bulk actions are enabled, the campaign moves through different states as a single unit. Each measurement period generates a campaign cycle that tracks Data collection, Approval, and Closed states for every metric in the campaign together, instead of each metric progressing independently.

    Now Assist introduced AI on the platform. As that experience has evolved, there's a new name for the experience. ServiceNow Otto® is the conversational AI platform integrated into ServiceNow workflows. It provides agentic capabilities, supports multimodal interactions across web, mobile, and messaging channels, and enables autonomous orchestration for cross-system workflows.The Now Assist for IRM \(sn\_irm\_gen\_ai\) plugin, which provides generative AI capabilities for RCM, has been renamed to ServiceNow Otto for IRM.
