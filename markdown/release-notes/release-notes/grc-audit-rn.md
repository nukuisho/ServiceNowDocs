# Audit Management release notes

The ServiceNow® Audit Management application supports activities related to planning audit engagements, executing engagements, and reporting findings to an audit committee. Audit Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Audit Management highlights for the Australia release

-   Improve audit data governance by introducing an audit entry framework that separates audit-specific \(third-line\) records from operational \(second-line\) records with controlled visibility.

See  for more information.

**Important:** Audit Management is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## New in the Australia release

-   **Audit entry fields on GRC objects**

    Classify the following GRC objects as third-line audit records using the new audit entry option:

    -   Entity
    -   Engagement
    -   Control objective
    -   Control
    -   Risk statement
    -   Risk
    Control visibility with role-based access so that only users with the sn\_audit\_ws.third\_line\_manager role can view audit entry \(third-line\) records. The **Audit entry** option is selected by default when the third-line manager creates a record and is set to read-only after the record is saved.

    **Note:** An administrator must manually assign the sn\_audit\_ws.third\_line\_manager role to a user to use this feature.
