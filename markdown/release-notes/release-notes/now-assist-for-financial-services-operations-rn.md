## New in the Australia release

Australia Patch 3

-   **[Insurance CSR support AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/agentic-contact-center-for-insurance-agents-overview.md)**

    Provides insurance CSRs with AI-driven live assistance during voice calls in Agentic Contact Center for Insurance. The agent monitors the call transcript and, when prompted, identifies the customer's intent and surfaces relevant insurance data and knowledge base content. The agent responds to typed queries, or the CSR can request to have the agent read the latest transcript to infer the customer's most recent question.

-   **[Insurance interaction context summary skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/using-now-assist-for-financial-services-operations-fso.md)**

    Generates a call-contextual summary in the Interaction page in Agentic Contact Center for Insurance. When a call is assigned to a CSR, the skill surfaces the customer's likely reason for calling, related cases, and relevant insurance products in the **Relevant details for this call** card.

-   **[Insurance CSR customer insights AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/agentic-contact-center-for-insurance-agents-overview.md)**

    Enables insurance CSRs to ask natural-language questions about a customer's insurance relationship directly from the Customer 360 page. The agent retrieves data from insurance policy, claims, and servicing sources, and returns contextual responses to the CSR.

-   **[Insurance Customer Profile Summarization skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/using-now-assist-for-financial-services-operations-fso.md)**

    Provides CSRs with AI-driven live assistance during voice calls. This AI agent monitors the transcript of the call. When prompted, the agent identifies customer intent, surfaces knowledge-based recommendations, and suggests next-best actions.

-   **[Customer interaction context summary skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/using-now-assist-for-financial-services-operations-fso.md)**

    Generates a call-contextual customer summary in the Interaction workspace in the Agentic Contact Center for Banking. This summary is scoped to the intent of the inbound call, providing the agent with a snapshot of the customer's situation when the call begins.

-   **[Banking CSR customer insights AI agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/agentic-contact-center-for-banking-agents-overview.md)**

    Enables CSRs to ask natural-language questions about a customer directly from the Customer 360 workspace. The agent aggregates data from predefined sources, then uses the information to generate accurate, contextually relevant answers.

-   **[Customer profile summarization skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/using-now-assist-for-financial-services-operations-fso.md)**

    Provides AI-generated summaries directly on the Customer 360 workspace in the Agentic Contact Center for Banking, reducing navigation across multiple systems.

-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md)**

    The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you a new AI experience with three licensing tiers available:

    -   Foundation: AI basics to deliver insights
    -   Advanced: AI to boost productivity across relevant use cases
    -   Prime: Act autonomously with all AI assets, and create your own

## Changed in this release

Australia Patch 4

-   **[Updated default model provider for Now Assist for FSO skills](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/configure-fso-now-assist-skills.md)**

    The Now LLM Service is no longer the default model provider for new or inactive AI assets. A third-party LLM is now selected by default, while existing configurations using the Now LLM Service continue unchanged. The Now LLM Service is still available for manual selection.
