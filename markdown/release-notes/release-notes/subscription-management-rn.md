## Australia

The ServiceNow® Subscription Management application enables you to manage your subscriptions proactively and monitor subscription usage on your instances. Subscription Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Support for domain separation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/domain-separation-subscription-mgmt.md)**

    View and filter subscribers by domain for user-based subscriptions and view Now Assist usage by domain.

-   **[Monitor Workflow Data Fabric usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/monitoring-wdf-capability-use.md)**

    Monitor and track Workflow Data Fabric capability usage and view the relative token use rate of each capability.


### What's changed

-   **[Now Assist usage excludes demo data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/monitoring-now-assist-usage.md)**

    Demonstration instances are excluded from the total Now Assist usage count to improve tracking of Assist consumption. The accrual time field displays when Now Assist data was last accrued.

-   **[Changes to Now Assist usage measurement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/monitoring-now-assist-usage.md)**

    Now Assist usage measurement is evolving. Update Subscription Management to version 6.1 or later on all instances to avoid mixed measurement states. For more information, see [Now Assist Usage - Overview &amp; New Measurement Logic: January 2026 \[KB2704710\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2704710) on the Now Support Knowledge Base.

-   **[Streamlined user-based subscription allocation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/managing-user-subscriptions-v2.md)**

    To simplify the Subscription Management experience, the manual allocation workflow for user-based subscriptions has been removed for administrators who have never used it. Administrators who have manually allocated user-based subscriptions before can still make manual allocations.

-   **[Hidden user-based subscription allocations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/subscriptions-overview-v2.md)**

    To help prevent inaccuracy when allocations aren't complete, allocation details for user-based subscriptions are now hidden from the Subscription Management overview. Contact your account executive for user-based subscription allocation details.
