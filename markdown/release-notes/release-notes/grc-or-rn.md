-   Validate Legal Entity Identifiers \(LEIs\) in real time against the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation \(GLEIF\) API across record forms, CSV downloads, and Microsoft Excel uploads. Use the LEI Validation Report for compliance tracking.

## June 2026

The ServiceNow® Operational Resilience application helps organizations maintain business services during adverse events, such as pandemics, severe weather, or cyber attacks. Operational Resilience was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Create reporting configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/create-reporting-configurations.md)**

    Manage document outputs centrally with the Reporting Configurations module in Digital resilience incident reporting. Administrators can manage template configurations, content configurations, and data relationship configurations from one place.

-   **[Validate Legal Entity Identifiers using GLEIF API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/create-legal-entity.md)**

    Validate Legal Entity Identifiers \(LEIs\) in real time against the GLEIF API across all four record form types — Legal Entity, Branch, Third Party, and Third Party Engagement. Name and country fields are auto-populated or cross-checked on create and update, with warnings shown on mismatch.During Microsoft Excel upload, a batch verification consolidates and validates all LEIs against GLEIF before processing, flagging warnings while allowing administrators to save flagged rows for later correction. During CSV package download, a dedicated LEI validation report is generated.

-   **[GLEIF API performance using system properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/properties-dora.md)**

    Configure GLEIF API behavior using the following system properties:

    -   **sn\_dora\_accel.gleif\_api\_batch\_size** — Controls how many LEIs are sent per request.
    -   **sn\_dora\_accel.gleif\_api\_timeout\_ms** — Sets the HTTP timeout per API call.
    -   **sn\_dora\_accel.lei\_save\_on\_gleif\_error** — Controls whether rows that fail GLEIF validation during Microsoft Excel upload are saved with warnings or rejected.
-   **[Duplicate record detection and warnings in reporting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/create-excel-upload-download-request.md)**

    Detect and prevent duplicate DORA records across key workflows. A business rule blocks saving on the Contractual arrangement form when a duplicate record is detected. Warnings are displayed when duplicate rows are found during CSV downloads.

-   **[Run advanced scenario analysis using simulation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/scenario-analysis-playbook-experience.md)**

    Plan and run advanced scenario analysis on a dedicated Scenario analysis record, capturing simulation method, dependencies, and assignee. Progress through the guided **Playbook** with stages for dependency scoping, scenario testing, result review, impact assessment, and final completion.Execute statistical model profiles to evaluate severe-but-plausible scenarios across services and dependencies. The record is locked once the treatment decision and reason are recorded.

-   **[Template versions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/set-up-sae-templates.md)**

    Track Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) template versions across assessment flows. New assessments automatically use the latest published Smart Assessment template version, while existing records on older versions continue to function without disruption. Assessment questions and automation logic handle different template versions correctly within the same flow.


### What's changed

-   **[Create reporting configurations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/create-reporting-configurations.md)**

    The Reporting Configurations module is provided in the Digital resilience incident reporting application to drive incident report generation.

-   **[Advanced scenario analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/scenario-analysis-playbook-experience.md)**

    The **Playbook** tab is provided in the Scenario analysis records.The **Statistical Modelling** and **Manual** options are available in the **Method** field on the **Details** tab.

## Australia

The ServiceNow® Operational Resilience application helps organizations maintain business services during adverse events, such as pandemics, severe weather, or cyber attacks. Operational Resilience was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Export action task reports](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/work-on-action-tasks.md)**

    Export DRIR assessment action task reports in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, or JSON format from a drop-down menu. Generate Microsoft Word documents for narrative reports, Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with structured question-answer layouts, or JSON files for system integrations.

-   **[Convert and aggregate contractual expenses to regulator-required currencies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/currency-conversion-aggregation.md)**

    Standardize annual expense values during Register of Information report generation by enabling optional currency conversion and third-party total expense aggregation. The application converts contract amounts to a base currency using 32 European Central Bank \(ECB\) exchange rates based on the reference date. Administrators upload monthly rates into the system. When eligibility criteria are met, expenses across multiple contracts are aggregated by third-party providers or engagements, generating consolidated reports that comply with DORA regulatory requirements.

-   **[Monetary values for DORA reporting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/properties-dora.md)**

    Control monetary value precision in DORA reports using the **sn\_dora\_accel.decimals\_monetary** system property. Set it to 0 to round to whole units, or a negative value \(for example, -3\) to round to thousands, based on regulator requirements.


### What's changed

-   **[Export action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/work-on-action-tasks.md)**

    The **Export** UI action on the action task form displays the following options: **Generate MS Word**, **Export Excel**, and **Export JSON**.

-   **[Excel download/upload request form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/create-excel-report-aggregate-expenses.md)**

    -   **Base currency**
    -   **Enable third-party total expense aggregation**
    -   **Reference date**
    -   **Date of the reporting**
    The **Type** field includes the **Plain-csv reporting package** option for generating reports in Comma-Separated Values \(CSV\) format.A business rule checks eight composite key fields when saving a contractual arrangement and displays a warning if a duplicate is found. B.05\_02 includes a link to open the duplicate record directly for comparison. B.05\_01 correctly includes ICT Intra-Group Service Provider \(Legal Entity providers\) in the ICT Third-Party Service Provider report.A warning is displayed when a Legal Entity Identifier \(LEI\) fails validation or a mismatch is detected against the GLEIF API across all four record form types.

-   **[Template versions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/governance-risk-compliance/set-up-sae-templates.md)**
