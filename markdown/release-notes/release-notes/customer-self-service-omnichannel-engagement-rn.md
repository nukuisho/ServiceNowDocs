    Agents can request supervisor assistance during active calls using the **Help Request** button, specify a reason to give supervisors context before they respond, and receive notifications when supervisors coach or join. All help request data is captured for reporting to support data-driven coaching. Additional agent workflow enhancements include:

    -   Configure the phone directory to show or hide the Agents, Queues, or External tabs based on CCaaS provider settings, preventing transfers to unsupported numbers.
    -   During active calls, agents can view real-time availability status for other agents in the transfer list and phone directory, supporting more informed transfer decisions.
-   **[Use AI to generate wrap up code and notes summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/ai-generated-wrap-up-codes-and-notes-summary.md)**

    Automatically suggest a wrap-up code and generate an interaction summary based on conversation transcripts by using Now Assist, which reduces manual documentation time and contributes to consistent record-keeping. Choose automatic or agent-initiated generation to fit your workflow.

-   **[Using the Consumer Portal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/use-consumer-portal.md)**

    Support your consumers through the Consumer Portal self-service capabilities such as knowledge articles, service catalogs, case management, Virtual Agent, and others. These capabilities help reduce maintenance effort through low-code configurations on pages with configurable widgets.

-   **[Native callback features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/contact-center-intergration-with-icc-callback.md)**

    Callback management enables agents to schedule callbacks on behalf of customers. The key features include:

    -   Enable agents to schedule callbacks from any interaction or case.
    -   Equip agents to reschedule or cancel callbacks from the callback record page with proper state tracking.
    -   Facilitate agents to view scheduled callbacks in the list view so they can open the individual callback record page.
    -   Enable agents to view and manage scheduled callbacks for the current interaction or case in the contextual side panel.
-   **[Email interaction feature: Wrap up of email interactions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/using-email-interaction-page.md)**

    Note the following capabilities introduced for wrapping up email interactions:

    -   Introduction of wrap‑up modal for Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\) and CCaaS‑routed email interactions with internal wrap‑up codes configurable by admins.
    -   Automatic closure of inactive interactions with system-assigned wrap-up codes in multiple scenarios:
        -   When agents create a case from an email interaction.
        -   When the wrap-up modal times out without agent submission.
        -   When customers don’t respond within the defined follow-up period.
-   **[Email interaction feature: Outbound Interaction from agent-initiated email](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/using-email-interaction-page.md)**

    The new capabilities for outbound interactions initiated by agents through email are:

    -   Initiate outbound email interactions from contact or consumer records by selecting email addresses or using the Compose Email UI option, opening a modeless email composer with the recipient's email address auto-populated.
    -   Automatic creation of Work‑In‑Progress \(WIP\) outbound email interactions when agents initiate an email to a customer.
    -   Preserve email drafts when agents navigate away, and automatically close interactions that show no sent or received email activity and contain only unsent drafts within a rolling 30‑day period. Any agent activity on the draft resets the 30‑day window.
    -   Consolidate multiple agent‑initiated drafts into a single, unified interaction within service workflows, with ownership assigned to the sending agent. You can optionally configure the system to create separate interactions for each draft for the same contact.
    -   Configurable reminder windows for sending automated reminder emails when customers don’t respond.
    -   Customer response notifications on the ongoing tab and interaction linking in contact or consumer related lists for seamless conversation tracking.

    Transfer CCaaS or AWA-routed email interactions to another queue or agent. When transferring to a queue, corresponding routing rules apply automatically. When transferring to a specific agent, the interaction is directly assigned.

-   **[Email interaction feature: Email reply routing and summarization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/using-email-interaction-page.md)**

    The new capabilities for smart email routing and summarization are:

    -   Receive customer email replies on the correct open case or interaction automatically, with ServiceNow Otto® selecting the best-matching case when multiple open cases exist.
    -   Get AI summaries automatically on transfer and on demand, reducing the need to read the full email thread.
    -   See summaries instantly on page refresh without re-running AI, and refresh with one click when new activity arrives on the interaction.
    **Note:** Check your entitlements to determine whether you have access to summarization and AI-based context matching.

-   **[Usage insights for call events enabled using Interaction Controls Component \(ICC\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/usage-insight-for-icc-enabled-call-events.md)**

    Monitor call events from ICC enabled agent sessions for the customer, in **Usage Insights** available under **Platform Analytics**. View, filter, and inspect event payloads for actions such as muting, recording, and coaching session initiation. To enable tracking, turn on the Analytics toggle in the agent's profile preferences and add the agent's **sys\_id** to the **sn\_openframe.logger.enabled.users** system property.

-   **[Amazon Connect SSO integration with ServiceNow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/amazon-connect-sso-integration-with-servicenow.md)**
