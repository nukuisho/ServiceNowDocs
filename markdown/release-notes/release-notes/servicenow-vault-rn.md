    Deploy the complete ServiceNow Vault offering on your instance with Vault Suite, which automates the installation of all paid ServiceNow Vault capabilities for instances with a ServiceNow Vault subscription. Vault Suite includes Vault Console, Field Encryption, Zero Trust Access \(Continuous Authentication, Location, and Session Access\), Log Export Service, Code Signing Enterprise, and Cloud Encryption, eliminating the manual plugin setup previously required to access the full set of ServiceNow Vault capabilities.

-   **Default Log Export Service configuration for Vault**

    Begin exporting security and audit logs from your instance with a preconfigured Log Export Service topic and curated log sources, designed for instances with a ServiceNow Vault subscription. Activate the default configuration in a single step from the Vault Console, with no manual setup required. Log Export Service version 3.5.0 or later must be installed on the instance.


-   **[Guided setup for custom applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/use-vault-guided-setup.md)**

    Use Ask Now Assist to enhance your security posture autonomously by identifying, classifying, and protecting sensitive data in your custom applications.

-   **[Securing custom apps with the Vault agents agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/now-assist-vault-securing-custom-apps-agents.md)**

    Propose data classifications and available protections for a custom application. When you install Now Assist for Vault, this agentic workflow is turned on by default.

    View, create, deactivate, and delete Access Observer settings for a particular field. The access observer configuration agentic workflow helps you monitor the people and processes that access data on your instance.

For example, you can ask Now Assist to summarize access logs to view users who accessed a field, along with their roles and how they accessed the data. When you install Now Assist for Vault, this agentic workflow is turned on by default.

    Identify unprotected sensitive data across your configured tables using the AI Insights section in the Vault console dashboard. View users entering sensitive data in unprotected columns and channels, grouped by sensitive data patterns. This information can further be used to prioritize protection efforts.

-   **[Guided setup for custom applications](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/use-vault-guided-setup.md)**

    Autoclassify and protect the occurrences of sensitive data within your custom applications using guided setup for Vault. This flow helps you to quickly start using Vault capabilities in your own applications.


## Changed in this release

-   **[Default model provider for AI assets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md)**

    The Now LLM Service is no longer the default model provider for new or inactive AI assets. A third-party LLM is now selected by default, while existing configurations using the Now LLM Service continue unchanged. The Now LLM Service is still available for manual selection. Azure OpenAI is the default model for all AI assets in Now Assist for Vault.
