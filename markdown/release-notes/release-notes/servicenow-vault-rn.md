[Australia Patch 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-5.md)

-   The `security_admin` role no longer appears on the elevated roles list required for Vault Console administration. This change was made to conform with the principle of least privilege, ensuring administrators only elevate to roles they actually need.

This change reflects the evolution of AI assistance features while existing entitlements remain unchanged. Check your entitlements to determine access to specific features.

[Australia Patch 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-3.md)

-   Receive the full value of your ServiceNow Vault subscription with the new Vault Suite, which installs the complete set of paid ServiceNow Vault capabilities, including Vault Console, Field Encryption, Zero Trust Access, Log Export Service, and Cloud Encryption, on entitled instances.
-   Begin exporting security and audit logs from your instance by default with a preconfigured Log Export Service topic and curated log sources.

[Australia Patch 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-1.md)

-   Enhance your security posture by securing the data in your custom applications with Ask Now Assist.
-   Surface sensitive data access by users automatically by leveraging Now Assist to configure, audit, and summarize your Access Observer logs.
