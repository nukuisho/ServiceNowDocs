## June 2026

The ServiceNow® Configuration Compliance application enables you to prioritize and remediate the most critical configuration-related vulnerabilities in your environment quickly and efficiently. Configuration Compliance was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Activate the Wiz Asset Integration and identify resource types for import](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/wiz-assets-resources-tab.md)**

    Enhancements to the Wiz integration include:

    -   Starting with version 32.1 \(USEM\) and version 4.1 \(non-USEM\), the Asset integration is deactivated by default. It is not a mandatory prerequisite for the other Wiz integration imports.

        If you choose to activate it, the Asset integration will retrieve assets for all resource types if you don't specify the ones you want on the **Asset Integration Configuration** tab. To avoid importing vulnerability data you don't need, identify only the resources \(assets\) that you want to import with this integration.

    -   Resource Type is no longer a mandatory field for configuring the Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz. You can now save Wiz configurations for the integrations without specifying a Resource Type, simplifying setup for use cases where specifying a Resource Type isn't appropriate.

## Australia General Availability

The ServiceNow® Configuration Compliance application enables you to prioritize and remediate the most critical configuration-related vulnerabilities in your environment quickly and efficiently. Configuration Compliance was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Tenable compliance test uniqueness key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/cc-tenable-compliance-test-uniqueness-key.md)**

    You can now configure which identifier the system uses to uniquely match incoming Tenable conformance test records. Previously, conformance tests were identified by the check\_id field, which caused records to be overwritten when multiple tests shared the same control identifier. You can now select the identifier that best matches how your Tenable data is structured \(**compliance\_control\_id**, **check\_id**, or **compliance\_functional\_id**\), ensuring test records are accurately preserved during ingestion.


## April 2026

The ServiceNow® Configuration Compliance application enables you to prioritize and remediate the most critical configuration-related vulnerabilities in your environment quickly and efficiently. Configuration Compliance was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[AWS Integration for Security Exposure Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/aws-integration-for-security-exposure-management-overview.md)**

    The AWS Integration for Security Exposure Management supports integrations with the following AWS services:

    -   AWS Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continuously scans EC2 instances, ECR container images, and Lambda functions for software vulnerabilities \(CVEs\) and unintended network exposure. The Vulnerability Response integration with AWS Inspector imports host and container vulnerability findings from AWS Inspector.
    -   AWS Security Hub is a security service that is used to centralize and update security checks across AWS accounts. It provides a unified view of security alerts and conformance status by integrating with various AWS services. The Vulnerability Response integration with AWS Security Hub imports host, container vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations from AWS Security Hub.
-   **[Optimized Tenable.io Compliance Results ingestion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/tenableIntegration.md)**

    Starting with v 6.1.3, the Tenable.io conformance Results Integration is replaced by the Tenable.io Fixed conformance Results Integration and Tenable.io Open conformance Results Integration. conformance results are now imported based on their status, optimizing ingestion performance and scalability for environments with large volumes of conformance data while keeping remediation and conformance tracking aligned with the current state of findings.

-   **[Qualys Integration – API enhancements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/c_QualysVulnIntegration.md)**

    The Qualys Vulnerability Integration has been upgraded to support newer Qualys API versions across Host Detection, Host List, Knowledgebase, PC Controls, PC Policies, and PCRS integrations. The integrations now ingest additional data fields, including vulnerability detection source, authentication privilege status, active status for controls and policies, and cloud metadata, giving you better visibility into your vulnerability and conformance data. Use the new `posture_api_version` integration instance parameter to choose between the default v2.0 APIs or the newer v5.0 streaming APIs for the PCRS Policy Host and PCRS Test Results integrations.

-   **[Unified Microsoft Defender Integration for Security Exposure Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/ms-defender-sem.md)**

    The Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Defender Threat and Vulnerability Management \(MS TVM\) plugins are now consolidated into a single plugin: Microsoft Defender Integration for Security Exposure Management. This consolidation deprecates the standalone Microsoft Defender for Cloud plugin. The unified plugin also introduces container image vulnerability ingestion from Microsoft Defender for Cloud, creating Container Vulnerable Items on your instance. A guided migration path is available to transfer existing data from the deprecated applications to the unified plugin.

-   **[Remediation task rule execution mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/sem-grouping-multiple-findings-remediation-tasks-processing.md)**

    You can now choose how remediation task rules are evaluated during ingestion. The new Match First execution mode evaluates rules sequentially and applies only the first matching rule, assigning each finding to exactly one remediation task. The default Match All mode continues to evaluate all applicable rules.


## Australia

The ServiceNow® Configuration Compliance application enables you to prioritize and remediate the most critical configuration-related vulnerabilities in your environment quickly and efficiently. Configuration Compliance was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **Enhancements to the Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz**

    Enhancements to the Wiz integration that imports cloud configuration findings as Test Results in Configuration Compliance. Configuration issues related to AI assets, such as AI models and agents are routed into AI security exposure management tables \(AI posture findings\).

    This enhancement helps with better visibility within AI Control Tower and for any AI-specific remediation workflows to be added in the future. The 'Send AI security findings to AI security exposure management' configuration setting has been added to the Wiz Test Results integration configuration page so that AI security findings are routed into AI security exposure management.

-   **[Qualys parameter to ignore passed test results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/Qualys-cc-Integration.md)**

    Starting with v15.2.5 of Configuration Compliance, the ignore\_passed\_result integration instance parameter for the Qualys Integration for Security Operations has been added.

    This parameter is set to `false` by default so that passed test results imported by Qualys aren't ignored.

    Set the parameter to **true** to ignore passed test results on import.

    **Note:** If activated, this parameter does not impact closure of the test results. For example, if you activate the parameter, and a failed test result from a previous import has since passed, it will be closed correctly.
