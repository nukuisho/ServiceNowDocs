# Security Incident Response release notes

The ServiceNow® Security Incident Response \(SIR\) application helps your organization connect security and IT teams, respond faster and efficiently to threats, and gain insight into your organization's security posture. Security Incident Response was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Security Incident Response highlights for the Australia release

-   Enable automated response actions by integrating CrowdStrike Next-Gen SIEM with the ServiceNow Security Incident Response platform to retrieve detections and convert them into security incidents.
-   Fetch closed offenses from IBM QRadar into Security Incident Response.
-   Rapidly build integrations for Security Incident Response using auto-code generation through the Now Assist LLM-powered integration builder.
-   Ingest MITRE D3FEND data and visualize attack–defense relationships through an interactive graph directly within a security incident.
-   Starting in version 14.1.0, you can do the following:
    -   Integrate Microsoft Defender with ServiceNow® SIR to turn incidents into actionable incidents, thus accelerating response from detection to closure.
    -   Added support for fetching closed incidents from IBM QRadar into Security Incident Response.
    -   View a chronological timeline of activities for a security incident — including state transitions, task updates, approvals, and MITRE ATT&amp;CK mappings directly within Security Incident Response Workspace.

See [Security Incident Response](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/sir-landing-page.md) for more information.

**Important:** Security Incident Response is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Microsoft Defender integration for Security Operations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/ms-defender.md)**

    As a profile admin:

    -   Create flexible event‑forwarding profiles to ingest Microsoft Defender incidents into ServiceNow® Security Incident Response.
    -   Map Microsoft Defender incident, alert, and event fields directly to SIR security incident fields.
    -   Filter out noisy or low‑value alerts and bring only actionable notable events into SIR.
    -   Ingest historical, ongoing, new, and updated notable events on configurable intervals.
    -   Bi-directional synchronization of status, and work notes between Microsoft Defender and ServiceNow® SIR.
-   **[Preview security incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/splunk-event-ingest-preview-security.md)**

    The Profile Preview now displays Unmatched Affected Users and Unmatched Configuration Items in related lists when no CMDB or identity match is found, allowing you to quickly review and validate unmapped data directly within the profile without navigating to external records.

    This enhancement is implemented across Splunk Enterprise Security, Splunk Enterprise Event Ingestion, and IBM QRadar integrations.

-   ****

    Track the complete history of a security incident events on a visual timeline within Security Incident Response Workspace. View event types as point or range events in chronological order such as state transitions, task creation and closure, approvals, observable additions, MITRE ATT&amp;CK and D3FEND mappings, and capability and playbook executions. Select any event to view details in a popover, filter by event type to focus on relevant activities. Administrators can configure custom event types, control how event data is retrieved, and define the fields displayed in event popovers.

-   **[Precedence-based override mode for threat lookup findings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/threat-lookup-finding-calculators.md)**

    A new precedence override mode for observable findings lets security teams control how the automated threat lookups interact with an existing finding severity. When enabled, severity upgrades from threat intelligence sources are applied immediately, while downgrades are deferred until a configurable expiry window elapses. You can configure the override mode and finding priority order on the Threat Intelligence Properties page.

-   **[Create OT change requests from security incidents and response tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/t_CrtChgOrPrbFromSI.md)**

    You can now create OT change requests directly from a security incident or a response task using the Create OT Change Request option in the form context menu.

    **Note:** The Create OT Change Request option is available only when the Operational Technology Change Management plugin \(com.sn\_ot\_chg\_mgmt\) and the Operational Technology Security Incident Response plugin \(com.sn\_ot\_sir\) are installed and activated on your instance.

-   **[Dedicated role and enhanced security for the Setup Assistant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/setup-assistant-reference.md)**

    The Setup Assistant now requires the dedicated sn\_secops\_setup.admin role for full access to setup configuration. Users with the sn\_si.admin role automatically inherit this role. The Setup Status \(sn\_secops\_setup\_status\) table fields are enforced as strict read-only to prevent unauthorized modifications.


[Australia Patch 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-1.md)

-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md)**

    The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you a new AI experience with three licensing tiers available:

    -   Foundation: AI basics to deliver insights
    -   Advanced: AI to boost productivity across relevant use cases
    -   Prime: Act autonomously with all AI assets, and create your own
    Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents.


-   **[CrowdStrike Next-Gen SIEM integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/crowdstrike-next-gen-integration-secops.md)**

    As a profile admin:

    -   Discover CrowdStrike Next-Gen SIEM detections that are candidates for security incidents and automate the creation of these security incidents.
    -   Create detection profiles.
    -   Map CrowdStrike Next-Gen SIEM detection and events fields to SIR security incident fields.
    -   Filter CrowdStrike Next-Gen SIEM defects.
    -   Aggregate detections to existing open security incidents so you don't have to create duplicate security incidents.
    -   Automate CrowdStrike Next-Gen SIEM detection status updates for Security Incident Response.
    -   Synchronize CrowdStrike Next-Gen SIEM detection comments with SIR Work notes.
-   **[Components installed with Security Incident Response](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/installed-with-sir.md)**

    A new Profile Admin role \(sn\_si.ingestion\_profile\_admin\) provides access to configure plugins, and enables you to create, edit, delete, and manage profiles for Splunk ES, Splunk Enterprise Event Ingestion, and Microsoft Azure Sentinel integration for Security Operations application.

-   **[Add unmatched affected user for security incidents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/view-unmatched-affected-user-for-si.md)**

    The new “Security Incident Unmatched Users” table captures unmatched affected user records for security incidents, enabling analysts to identify and address discrepancies when user records don't match existing system records.
