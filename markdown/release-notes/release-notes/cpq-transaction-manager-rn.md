# CPQ release notes

CPQ is a configuration engine that acts as the "C" in Configure, Price, Quote. It uses an attribute-based approach to simplify complex product logic. The engine delivers dynamic blueprints, real-time user interfaces, and a Commerce Logic Engine that generates accurate outputs like bills of materials.

## About CPQ

-   Configure price and quantity ramps for subscription products directly in the CPQ Configurator, with support for split lines, reconfiguration, and delta pricing.
-   Pre-populate configuration fields at the start of a configuration session by mapping incoming request data, such as line attributes and characteristics, to config fields directly in the CPQ admin UI.
-   Enable agents to invoke Config AI capabilities directly using the Agent-to-Agent \(A2A\) protocol, without requiring manual integration setup.
-   Upload deal-specific documents such as customer emails, RFPs, and meeting notes so that Config AI and Quote AI have full deal context when generating configurations and quotes.
-   Upload organizational documents such as pricing policies, standard operating procedures, and product specifications so that Config AI and Quote AI reference your company's specific rules and standards during configuration and quoting sessions.
-   Manage transaction lines more precisely using natural language by targeting specific line numbers, adding favorited products, triggering events, updating header fields, and clearing field values directly from a prompt.
-   Review and act on Smart Predict recommendations directly inline in the configuration layout, with controls to accept or dismiss individual values or accept all recommendations at once at the layout or group level.
-   Use the guided setup to step through the initial configuration of the CPQ configurator.
-   Configure and manage thousands of line items with a single‑page, scalable transaction user experience that includes search, filtering, rollups, and in‑memory rule execution.
-   Achieve consistent pricing, validations, and process control without heavy scripting using attribute‑based rules, events, calculations, and workflow stages.
-   Integrate with Salesforce, ServiceNow, and downstream systems using ServiceNow Quote Experience API‑first design, which acts as the system of record for transaction data while remaining CRM‑agnostic.
-   Duplicate an existing solution configuration node in a set, directly from the solution configuration navigation sidebar to use it as the starting point for a new node.
-   Enable AI-assisted quote creation, modification, and automated generation by interpreting user intent and contextual triggers with Quote AI Agent.

## Activation and other requirements

-   **Activation information**

    Features such as product and configuration sharing in ServiceNow Quote Experience features, require activation by ServiceNow. Submit a support ticket to enable these features.


## Accessibility and localization

-   **Accessibility information**

    The CPQ runtime configuration experience includes the following keyboard and screen reader accessibility improvements.

    -   Navigate and select options in single-select picklists, selectable product cards, and the product picker grid using a keyboard.
    -   Shopping cart and bill of materials \(BOM\) column headers are announced as text with full, untruncated labels, and table cells reference their row and column headers for screen reader context.
    -   Field labels are read across transaction runtime fields, keyboard focus returns to the date input after a calendar selection, and the field edit page provides more descriptive context for related item tiles and tooltips.
    -   The CPQ and ServiceNow Quote Experience runtime interface supports 400% zoom without loss of content or functionality, meeting the WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.10 \(Reflow\). Users who rely on screen magnification can navigate and interact with the quoting experience at 400% zoom on a standard viewport.
    The CPQ admin UI includes the following keyboard and screen reader accessibility improvements:

    -   Skip links on list pages allow keyboard users to bypass navigation and go directly to main content or grid rows.
    -   Grid column headers announce sort direction, and sort indicators appear as separate elements to reduce announcement clutter.
    -   The New button announces the specific entity type to be created, field edit page tooltips are read aloud on focus, and related item tiles provide more descriptive context for assistive technology users.
    The CPQ runtime configuration and transaction experience includes the following keyboard and screen reader accessibility improvements:

    -   Navigate and select options in single-select picklists, selectable product cards, and the product picker grid using a keyboard.
    -   Radio button groups and rectangular pushbutton groups retain their selection when navigating away using a screen reader.
    -   The complete text of shopping cart or BOM column headers is announced; table cells reference their row and column headers for screen reader context.
    -   Field labels are read across transaction runtime fields, and keyboard focus returns to the date input after a calendar selection.
    -   Expandable section headers announce error indicators, field-level error messages are read aloud on input focus, and help popover content is reachable by screen readers.
    The CPQ AI runtime experience includes the following keyboard and screen reader accessibility improvements:

    -   The Config AI view is reachable and navigable using a keyboard, so users aren't misdirected to fields in the main layout during configuration sessions.
    -   Quote AI is accessible using keyboard navigation and screen readers.
    -   Smart Predict runtime experience elements, including trigger icons, notification icons, and modal interactions, are accessible using keyboard navigation and screen readers.
-   **Localization information**

    Japanese Localization for CPQ admin UI: The CPQ admin UI supports internationalization for the CPQ Configurator and Transaction Manager. Static user interface elements, including labels, headings, and system text, can be displayed in Japanese. This is part of an initial pilot to support SoftBank onboarding. Administrators can select their preferred language through the ServiceNow platform. If any static content is not translated, the system automatically falls back to English. It also supports Japanese character input across applicable fields and controls. User-generated content remains in the language in which it is entered.

    Enhanced localization in CPQ: Translation and localization support is enhanced to include product offering labels, definitions, and field text in CPQ. Content is translated at compile time, enabling multilingual configuration workflows and a more consistent localized experience.

-   **Share product favorites**

    Improve collaboration and user efficiency by sharing saved favorite products and configurations with other users, enabling sharing and reuse of product configurations.

-   **Tenant-configurable namespace prefixes for Salesforce fields**

    Configure a custom namespace at the tenant level to align Salesforce fields and references with your managed package. When a custom namespace is set, CPQ uses it for all generated Salesforce fields and all field lookups instead of the default LGK\_ prefix. If no custom namespace is configured, the system defaults to LGK\_ to preserve compatibility with existing tenants.

-   **Dynamic selection of Sales CRM catalog items in the CPQ admin UI**

    Select product offerings, product specifications, and product characteristic values directly in the CPQ admin UI without manually entering system IDs. Search and select Sales CRM catalog items using built-in UI selectors when configuring products, creating product rules, or setting up pickers, advanced product actions, BOM enrichments, and library functions.

    Duplicate an existing solution configuration node in a set, directly from the solution configuration navigation sidebar to use it as the starting point for a new node. The original node in a set must be in the valid state.

-   **[Config Converse](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/cpq-config-converse.md)**

    Configure complex products using natural language. Buyers can submit a configuration request through a prompt field on an administrator-designed landing page. The request is processed by an AI agent, which interprets the input and drives the product configuration session. For renewal scenarios, Config AI can reuse a previous configuration as a starting point, enabling faster upsell and cross-sell opportunities while maintaining continuity across renewal cycles. Using Config AI, you can:

    -   Submit product configuration requests using natural language through a prompt field on the landing page.
    -   Complete product configuration through a conversational interface within the buying experience.
    -   Design the Config Converse landing page using the CPQ layout editor with configurable elements such as text, images, fields, and a prompt component.
    -   Allow buyers to skip the landing page using a dismissal preference in the layout editor.
    -   Check for a predicted configuration after the initial buyer request. Apply it automatically when Smart Predict is enabled for both the tenant and the layout. Smart Predict must be enabled separately at the tenant level and at the layout level.
-   **[Enable order creation from a quote](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/configure-create-order-integration.md)**

    Create an order directly from a quote in the CPQ Quote experience. Convert an entire quote into an order in a single step, or select specific top-level line items to order only part of a quote. Quote line items and their related details carry straight onto the order as order lines, giving sales teams a faster, more accurate quote-to-order handoff with less manual rework.
