# Quote Management release notes

The ServiceNow® Quote Management enables your sales agents to generate and manage sales quotes for your customers. Quote Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## About Quote Management

-   Quickly understand the financial outcome of quote changes, making it easier to review, approve, and act on updated quotes with visibility into exact amounts owed.
-   Enable sales agents to set a target outcome for a quote and let automated adjustments handle header-level discounting, removing manual trial-and-error and speeding up quote approvals.
-   Improve quote data consistency by validating contract start and end dates across quote headers, parent lines, and child lines, preventing date conflicts during updates.
-   Enable greater flexibility in managing amendment quotes by splitting active ramp segments into shorter intervals, adjusting quantities, and maintaining accurate line types throughout the quote life cycle.
-   Enhance quote approval workflows with automated reminders, escalations, override capabilities, and ad-hoc approvals for greater control and accountability throughout the approval process.
-   [Australia Patch 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-1.md)Summarize a quote with Now Assist for immediate, comprehensive insights into quote details \(product, pricing, and terms\) to improve quote accuracy, help teams align, reduce manual review, catch issues early, and accelerate quote turnaround.
-   Use a conversational AI agent to handle the full spectrum of quoting tasks, from simple line-item updates to complex multi-product configurations, through a single interface.
-   Improve pricing accuracy on quotes by automatically adding, updating, and removing system-generated lines in response to pricing rule changes, without requiring manual edits.

## July 2026

The ServiceNow® Quote Management enables your sales agents to generate and manage sales quotes for your customers. Quote Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **Transaction Manager Quote AI Agent**

    Use a conversational AI agent to manage quote-level operations directly in Transaction Manager. The agent handles a broad range of quoting tasks through a single interface:

    -   Search for products and match them to your request, then delegate configuration to Config AI for configurable products.
    -   Update line items and header fields, apply discounts, and trigger events.
    -   Generate a visible execution plan before acting on complex requests, so you can see what will happen and why.
    -   Run independent operations in parallel, so multiple configurations can complete simultaneously without blocking other changes.

-   **Derived pricing on quotes**

    Improve pricing accuracy by letting the system automatically manage derived quote lines based on pricing rule responses. When pricing rules are evaluated, the system handles line-level changes for you based on source product offer lines and their date ranges:

    -   Adds new system-generated lines when pricing rules require them.
    -   Updates existing derived lines when pricing conditions change.
    -   Removes derived lines that no longer apply.
    -   Restricts editing on system-generated lines to preserve pricing integrity.
