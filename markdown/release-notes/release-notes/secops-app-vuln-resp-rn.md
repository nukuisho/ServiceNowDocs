# Application Vulnerability Response release notes

The ServiceNow® Application Vulnerability Response application brings security and IT together to enable you to remediate your most critical vulnerabilities more quickly and efficiently. Application Vulnerability Response was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Application Vulnerability Response highlights for the Australia release

-   Import application vulnerability response data that includes application, Software Composition Analysis \(SCA\) and secrets data with the Wiz Application Vulnerability Response Integration.
-   If you're currently using Application Vulnerability Response and you want to upgrade to Unified Security Exposure Management \(USEM\), see [Unified Security Exposure Management \(USEM\) notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/secops-sem-rn.md) for more information about USEM and the Unified Security Exposure Management migration.
-   Integrate with supported third-party scanners to import vulnerability data and use automated workflows to prioritize, remediate, and manage findings \(application vulnerable items \(AVITs\)\). Each application vulnerability represents a vulnerability entry in the Common Weakness Enumeration \(CWE\) or third-party libraries.
-   Monitor your penetration test requests and findings, as well as your team's overall progress in the Penetration Test Workspace.
-   Reevaluate the risk score, assignments, remediation target date, exceptions, and remediation task for a specific set of application vulnerable items in the Vulnerability Manager Workspace.
-   Compare application vulnerability-related data and determine if application vulnerabilities are found in an application.

See [Application Vulnerability Response](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/app-vuln-mgmt.md) for more information.

**Important:** Application Vulnerability Response is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## Important information for upgrading Application Vulnerability Response to Australia

-   If you are currently using Application Vulnerability Response, and you do not intend to upgrade to Unified Security Exposure Management \(USEM\), install a version below v30.x of Application Vulnerability Response and for upgrades to supported third-party integration applications.
-   For information about the new features of Vulnerability Response, see the [Vulnerability Response release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/secops-vuln-resp-rn.md).
-   For more information about the released versions of the Application Vulnerability Response application as well as the third-party and ServiceNow applications that are compatible with the Australia release, see the [Vulnerability Response Compatibility Matrix and Release Schema Changes \[KB0856498\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0856498) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Enhancements to the Invicti Vulnerability Integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/invicti-vuln-integration.md)**

    Added the Invicti Platform Integration. Support for the Invicti Platform APIs introduces three new integration jobs that connect directly to the Invicti Platform cloud service:

    -   Application Integration — Imports the list of applications being scanned in Invicti Platform into your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance as discovered applications.
    -   Scan Integration — Pulls scan records from Invicti Platform, providing scan metadata to correlate with vulnerability findings.
    -   Vulnerability Integration — Imports application vulnerability findings from Invicti Platform and creates or updates application vulnerable items in Vulnerability Response in your ServiceNow AI Platform®.
    Enhancements to Application life-cycle management: When an application is deleted or decommissioned in Invicti Platform, your ServiceNow AI Platform® automatically deactivates the corresponding discovered application and closes all associated application vulnerable items \(AVITs\), keeping your vulnerability inventory accurate without manual cleanup.

-   **[Configuring lookup rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/sem-configure-lookup-rules.md)**

    The Applies to field is added to the Rules page for Configuration \(CI\) lookup rule records. For third-party and ServiceNow® integrations that support both Application Vulnerability Response \(AVR\) and Vulnerability Response \(VR\) lookup rules, like the Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz, for example, select one for a rule:

    -   **Discovered Application** for Application Vulnerability Response lookup rules.
    -   **Discovered Item** for Vulnerability Response lookup rules.
    **Note:** The field is left empty by default. If you leave this field empty for lookup rules that support both VR and AVR integrations, background jobs for both applications apply changes on the same set of lookup rules. This state might cause a conflict and set the reapply flag incorrectly. With this distinction set, after the respective background jobs for AVR and VR are completed, the system resets the flag only for the lookup rules for the background job that was run.

-   **[Activate the Wiz Asset Integration and identify resource types for import](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/wiz-assets-resources-tab.md)**

    Enhancements to the Wiz integration include:

    -   Starting with version 32.1 \(USEM\) and version 4.1 \(non-USEM\), the Asset integration is deactivated by default and is not a mandatory prerequisite for the other Wiz integration imports.

        If you choose to activate it, the Asset integration will retrieve assets for all resource types if you don't specify the ones you want on the **Asset Integration Configuration** tab. To avoid importing vulnerability data you don't need, identify only the resources \(assets\) that you want to import with this integration.

    -   Resource Type is no longer a mandatory field for configuring the Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz. You can now save Wiz configurations for the integrations without specifying a Resource Type, simplifying setup for use cases where specifying a Resource Type isn't appropriate.
-   **[Wiz Application Vulnerability Response Integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/wiz-exploring-avr-sca-secrets.md)**

    Import application, Software Composition Analysis \(SCA\), findings, Secrets \(passwords, tokens and keys\) data with the following Wiz Vulnerability integrations:

    -   Application List Integration
    -   SCA Findings Integration
    -   Secret Findings Integration
    You can configure these integrations on the Wiz Vulnerability Integration configuration page along with the other Wiz Vulnerability integrations. View imported application list data such as Product Model and Source application ID from Wiz on the Discovered Applications \[sn\_vul\_app\_release\] table records, and SCA and Secrets data on the Application Vulnerable Items \[sn\_vul\_app\_vulnerable\_item\] table records.

-   **[GitHub Application Vulnerability Integration – Generic secrets support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/configure-github-vulnerability.md)**

    The GitHub Secret Scanning Integration supports imports of generic secrets in addition to standard secrets from your GitHub repositories. An enhanced Manage generic secrets in ServiceNow configuration option lets you control whether generic secrets are ingested. Imported secrets are mapped to Application Vulnerable Items \(AVITs\) with the scan type, Secret, while generic secrets are mapped with the scan type, Generic Secret.

-   **[Improved vulnerability assessment workflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/vr-ws-vuln-assessment.md)**
    -   CI filtering for vulnerability assessments: You can now filter which configuration items are included in a vulnerability assessment using a condition builder.
    -   Business Application population on AVITs: AVITs created from SBOM assessment results now include Business Application information, helping you understand application impact and prioritize remediation.
    -   Priority roll‑down from vulnerability assessments: Updates to the priority of a vulnerability assessment now automatically roll down to associated VITs and AVITs, ensuring consistent prioritization based on the highest severity.
-   **[Enhanced Compensatory controls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/requesting-approving-risk-reduction.md)**

    When new vulnerable items are ingested and associated with a remediation task that already has an approved compensating control, the reduced risk rating is now automatically inherited by those new vulnerable items.
