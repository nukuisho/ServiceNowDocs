    The article length scan is a script‑based, non‑AI scan that runs in the background while authors work on articles. This scan evaluates articles against two length‑based criteria, namely: minimum length for search engine optimization, and maximum length for AI search. Articles with fewer than 300 words are flagged for search engine optimization, and don't appear in search results. Articles exceeding 10,000 words are flagged for AI search indexation, and don't appear in AI‑powered search results.
