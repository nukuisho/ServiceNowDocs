# Operational Technology Manager release notes

The ServiceNow® Operational Technology Manager application enables you to aggregate Operational Technology \(OT\) device data from multiple sources so you can build foundational data relationships in the Industrial solution. Operational Technology Manager was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## Operational Technology Manager highlights for the Australia release

[Australia Patch 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-4.md)

-   The Now LLM Service is no longer the default model provider for new or inactive AI assets.

[Australia Patch 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-3.md)

-   Help promote system security by using Enhanced Access Control for OT.

[Australia Patch 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-1.md)

-   The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you a new AI experience with three licensing tiers available.

Australia Early Availability

-   Get a deeper look into your OT network with the OT network map in the Industrial Workspace, where you can view a site, its subnets, and the OT devices in each subnet.
-   Keep your OT device data updated by using the Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) OT class model updates and UI enhancements.

See for [Operational Technology Manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/operational-technology-manager.md) more information.

**Important:** Operational Technology Manager is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Now LLM service deprecation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md)**

    The Now LLM Service is no longer the default model provider for new or inactive AI assets. A third-party LLM is now selected by default, while existing configurations using the Now LLM Service continue unchanged. The Now LLM Service is still available for manual selection.


-   **[Use Enhanced Access Control for OT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/ot-enhanced-access-control.md)**

    Enhanced Access Control for OT implements data filters, deny unless access control rules \(ACLs\), and ACL query rules to help promote system security.


-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md)**

    The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you a new AI experience with three licensing tiers available:

    -   Foundation: AI basics to deliver insights
    -   Advanced: AI to boost productivity across relevant use cases
    -   Prime: Act autonomously with all AI assets, and create your own
    Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents.


-   **[Operational Technology Network Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/utilizing-ot-network-map.md)**

    Use the OT network map available in the Industrial Workspace to view the subnets of a site and the OT devices in each subnet.

-   **[CMDB OT class model updates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/cmdb-ci-class-models-operation-technology.md)**

    Configure for your OT devices with the following CMDB OT class model updates:

    -   The IP Network Subnets related list was added to IT devices in the OT view. The list shows all subnets related to the device and IP Network subnets for the selected OT device.
    -   The IP Network Subnets related list was added to the following CMDB classes:

        -   cmdb\_ci\_display
        -   cmdb\_ci\_firewall\_network
        -   cmdb\_ci\_security
        -   cmdb\_ci\_ids\_network
