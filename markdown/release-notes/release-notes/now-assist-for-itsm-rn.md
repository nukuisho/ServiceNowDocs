**Important:** Now Assist for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

## Important information for upgrading Now Assist for IT Service Management \(ITSM\) to Australia

To use the Knowledge Article Advanced Editor page in the generate a knowledge article skill, you must activate the knowledge content recommendation skill. Follow these steps to activate the skill.

1.  Go to **Admin** &gt; **Now Assist admin**.
2.  Select **Now Assist Skills**.
3.  Select **Platform**.
4.  Select **Knowledge**.
5.  Make sure the knowledge content recommendation skill is active.

The incident assist agentic workflow is active by default and includes all the capabilities of the \[DEPRECATED\] incident assist skill, with enhancements. When you upgrade to [Australia Patch 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-1.md), if you have the \[DEPRECATED\] incident assist skill activated, consider deactivating it to avoid redundancy. For more information, see [Incident assist skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/now-assist-itsm-incident-assist.md).

Starting with the [Australia Patch 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-2.md), the Incident assist skill has been deprecated, moved to the **Archive** section, and is no longer available for use.

## Changed in this release

-   **[Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md)**

    The Now LLM Service is no longer the default model provider for new or inactive AI assets. A third-party LLM is now selected by default, while existing configurations using the Now LLM Service continue unchanged. The Now LLM Service is still available for manual selection.

-   **[Customize the change risk assessment answer generator skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/cust-now-assist-itsm-change-risk-assessment-skill.md)**

    Control the data that the change risk assessment answer generator skill uses to suggest answers. Create, modify, or deactivate **AI Risk Data Sources** to change which related records and knowledge articles the skill receives. Six data sources are available out of the box, including related affected CIs, impacted services, impacted business applications, service offerings, active change tasks, and outages. To change which change request fields the skill reads, update the `sn_itsm_gen_ai.com.snc.asmt_answer_generator.change_request_fields` system property.

-   **[IT Service Management AI agent collection assess quality of a change request agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/now-assist-itsm-aiagents-assess-quality-change-request-workflow.md)**
    -   Use the assess quality of a change request agentic workflow to rate a change request and get field improvement suggestions. The change quality assessor AI agent rates the request against an active change policy document, suggesting values only for fields the policy defines. If no policy applies, the agent rates the request against similar closed change requests.
    -   The agent scores the short description, description, implementation plan, backout plan, test plan, risk and impact analysis, and justification. Results are recorded in the **AI Change Quality Scores** table.
    -   Track change quality trends in Platform Analytics on the `ai_change_quality_score` table. A line chart shows the average score by month.
    -   To change how the agent evaluates a field, or to assess a custom field, override the `POLICY_EXTRACTION_KEYS` entries in the `ChangeQualityUtil` script rather than the protected `ChangeQualityUtilSNC` script. This ensures your changes remain after you upgrade. Use the `u_custom_field` entry to assess a custom field, and use the `overall_chg_policy` entry to set policies for the whole change request.

-   **[Some generative AI skills are turned on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md)**

    The new default behavior works as follows:

    -   New customers: When you install an AI product, designated skills are turned on automatically.
    -   Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Australia Early Access\): Any previously unconfigured skill is turned on automatically \(the skill was never configured and turned on, then turned off again\). Previously configured skills that were turned on, then off, remain inactive.
-   **[Renaming the Incident assist skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-service-management/now-assist-itsm-incident-assist.md)**

    The incident assist skill has been renamed to **\[DEPRECATED\] Incident assist**.
