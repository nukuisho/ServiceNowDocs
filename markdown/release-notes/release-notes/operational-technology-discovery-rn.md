See [Operational Technology Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/operational-technology-discovery-landing.md) for more information.

## New in the Australia release

-   **[Create a backup for the Console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/create-console-backup-concept.md)**

    To support disaster recovery, the Discovery Console for OT generates backup files containing restore data, configuration, and logs.

-   **[Install containerized OT Discovery packages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/install-containerized-ot-discovery-packages.md)**

    Containerized versions of the Console and the Collector are now available to download from the OT Discovery Downloads page. For detailed instructions, see [Air-gapped networks and OT Discovery installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/air-gapped-networks-installation.md).

-   **[Generate a certificate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/generate-new-certificate-discovery-for-ot.md)**

    You can now select the link **Download Console Certificate Bundle \(.ZIP\)**. The bundle contains the Console's Certificate and the web browser certificate. These certificates establish trust between these applications and confirm their communications are secure and encrypted.

-   **[Set up a Microsoft Entra ID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/users-entra-id-setup.md)**

    The Entra ID integration enables you to log in to the Console using your organization's Microsoft Entra ID cloud identity access management \(IAM\) credentials. This eliminates managing separate usernames and passwords within the application. This integration supports secure authentication using Microsoft Entra ID, improving user experience and aligning with enterprise identity management practices.


## UI changes

-   **[Edit an Appliance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/edit-an-appliance.md)**

    The Appliances page now displays individual Sensors and Collectors with their status and location. The page displays the component type, its endpoint, and CPU usage. Select the appliance name to see its details and additional settings.

-   **[Filter results for Host Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/results-filter-host-status.md)**

    In the Scan Results filtering types, the **Host Status** helps you view query results based on whether the queried host was **Up** or **Down**. This filter is derived from the Nmap XML status field inside the Raw scan output.


## Changed in this release

-   **[Requirements for Discovery Console for OT installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/reqs-ot-console-installation.md)**

    The required dependency version has been changed to .NET 10 from .NET 8
