## New in the Australia release

-   **Install ITOM Visibility apps using Now Assist for Setup**

    Now Assist for Setup provides a centralized, guided installation experience for ITOM Visibility. From a single interface, administrators can review what applications are included in the installation, review the installation status, and install all required applications and plugins.


-   **[PowerShell 7 support for Discovery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/powershell-remoting.md)**

    Discovery now supports PowerShell 7, while maintaining backward compatibility with PowerShell 5.1. This update enhances security, accelerates onboarding, and reduces deployment blockers through improved runtime detection and comprehensive test coverage.

-   **[Discovery on Code Signing instances](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/code-sign-disco-probes.md)**

    Discovery now enforces code signing for probes, parameters, and sensors to guarantee authenticity, integrity, and secure execution on MID Servers. This update blocks unsigned or tampered payloads, provides signature validation, and strengthens compliance by helping prevent audit gaps without impacting discovery performance.

-   **[Discovery generic attributes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/disco-generic-attributes.md)**

    Enhance Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) data accuracy with new Discovery capabilities that auto-populate non-discoverable attributes using a schedule-based mechanism. This update simplifies configuration item \(CI\) management by propagating generic attribute values across schedules and ranges, reducing manual effort and improving usability.

-   **[Use Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\) and Service Mapping to create service maps for extended services beyond Kubernetes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/mapping-k8s-sm-kva.md)**

    Service Mapping complements Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\) capabilities to map services that include Kubernetes and all related service resources beyond the Kubernetes environment. Install the latest version of Kubernetes Visibility Agent \(KVA\) to detect the latest changes in your Kubernetes cluster and run Service Mapping to have an up to date visualization of your services across Kubernetes and related resources.

-   **[Quick start tests for Service Mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-operations-management/quick-start-tests-service-mapping.md)**

## Related ServiceNow applications and features

-   ****

    The ServiceNow® ITOM AIOps product includes the ServiceNow® Event Management and ServiceNow® Metric Intelligence applications, which help you track and maintain the health of services in your organization.

    Event Management gathers alerts from infrastructure events that both third-party monitoring tools and the ServiceNow® internal agent capture. Event Management uses IT-related information that ServiceNow® Discovery gathers so it can map alerts to configuration items. Based on the collected information, Event Management then provides dashboards that show a consolidated view of all service-impact events.

    The Agent Client Collector application enables you to do the following:

    -   Monitor your service availability.
    -   Examine the health and performance of your environment.
    -   Ensure that your infrastructure and its applications are running properly.
    Agent Client Collector collects events and metrics. It runs in either a Windows or Linux environment.
