# Vulnerability Response release notes

The ServiceNow® Vulnerability Response application brings security and IT together to enable you to remediate your most critical vulnerabilities more quickly and efficiently. Vulnerability Response was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

## About Vulnerability Response

-   The AWS Integration for Security Exposure Management supports integrations with AWS Inspector and AWS Security Hub.
-   The Central Vulnerability Database \(CVDB\) introduces a source-agnostic vulnerability data layer that consolidates data from multiple sources, improving accuracy and traceability.
-   Define the number of background jobs that run concurrently to reduce system resource consumption, with a new Background Job Configuration tile available in the Vulnerability Manager Workspace Admin console under the Others section.

See [Vulnerability Response](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/vuln-landing-page.md) for more information.

## Activation and other requirements

**Important:** Vulnerability Response is available in the ServiceNow Store. For details, see the "Activation information" section of these release notes.

-   **Activation information**

    Install Vulnerability Response and supported third-party integrations by requesting them from the ServiceNow Store. Visit the [ServiceNow Store](https://store.servicenow.com/sn_appstore_store.do#!/store/home) to view all the available apps, and for information about submitting requests to the store. For cumulative release notes information for all released apps, see the [ServiceNow Store version history release notes](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/store-release-notes/sn-store-release-notes.html).

-   **Upgrade information**

    Starting with Australia Patch 5, Now Assist for Vulnerability Response is being prepared for future deprecation. It will be hidden and no longer installed on new instances but will continue to be supported. For details, see the [Deprecation Process \[KB0867184\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0867184) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

    ServiceNow Otto® is the new AI experience brand. This change is reflected in the name of ServiceNow products, including the Now Assist for Vulnerability Response product name, which will be replaced with ServiceNow Otto for Unified Security Exposure Management. Your product entitlements remain unchanged. Check your entitlements to determine your access to specific features.

    If you're currently using Vulnerability Response, and you do not intend to upgrade to Unified Security Exposure Management \(USEM\), install a version below v30.x of Vulnerability Response and for upgrades to supported third-party integration applications.

    For more information about the released versions of the Vulnerability Response application as well as the third-party and ServiceNow applications that are compatible with the Australia release, see the [Vulnerability Response Compatibility Matrix and Release Schema Changes \[KB0856498\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0856498) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base

    Starting with the Australia release, the Patch update and Collection fields on patch deployment records for the Microsoft SCCM and HCL BigFix Patch Orchestration integrations are deprecated in favor of new multi-value Patch updates and Collections fields, which support deploying more than one patch to more than one collection or computer group in a single deployment. Existing values in the deprecated fields are automatically migrated to the new fields during the upgrade. The deprecated fields remain on the form but are no longer used to create new deployments.

## September 2026

The ServiceNow® Vulnerability Response application brings security and IT together to enable you to remediate your most critical vulnerabilities more quickly and efficiently. Vulnerability Response was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Automatic re-evaluation of remediation tasks on preferred solution change](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/vulnerability-groups.md)**

    Remediation tasks can now automatically re-evaluate vulnerable items when their Preferred solution changes, so items are regrouped into the appropriate remediation task without manual intervention. This helps keep remediation tasks accurate and reduces manual cleanup.

-   **[Automatically create vulnerable items and application vulnerable items during assessment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/vr-va-ws-cve-exposure-assessment-api.md)**

    Vulnerability assessments now support an Auto-create VITs/AVITs option that automatically creates vulnerable items and application vulnerable items for their affected configuration items and products, removing the need for a separate manual create step. The new CVE Exposure Assessment REST API lets external systems set this option when creating a vulnerability assessment record, or trigger a CVE exposure assessment independently.


## August 2026

The ServiceNow® Vulnerability Response application brings security and IT together to enable you to remediate your most critical vulnerabilities more quickly and efficiently. Vulnerability Response was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Streamline Microsoft SCCM data ingestion with JDBC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/mspatch-integration.md)**

    Connect to Microsoft SCCM using JDBC \(Java Database Connectivity\) to query the SCCM database directly for collection, device, patch update, and deployment status data. Opening a firewall port for WMI \(Windows Management Instrumentation\) RPCs \(remote procedure calls\) is no longer required for these queries. A WMI connection remains required to deploy patches, because patch deployment continues to use the Microsoft SCCM API over WMI.


## July 2026

The ServiceNow® Vulnerability Response application brings security and IT together to enable you to remediate your most critical vulnerabilities more quickly and efficiently. Vulnerability Response was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Enhancements to the Invicti Vulnerability Integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/invicti-vuln-integration.md)**

    Added the Invicti Platform Integration. Support for the Invicti Platform APIs introduces three new integration jobs that connect directly to the Invicti Platform cloud service:

    -   Application Integration — Imports the list of applications being scanned in Invicti Platform into your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance as discovered applications.
    -   Scan Integration — Pulls scan records from Invicti Platform, providing scan metadata to correlate with vulnerability findings.
    -   Vulnerability Integration — Imports application vulnerability findings from Invicti Platform and creates or updates application vulnerable items in Vulnerability Response in your ServiceNow AI Platform®.
    Enhancements to Application life-cycle management: When an application is deleted or decommissioned in Invicti Platform, your ServiceNow AI Platform® automatically deactivates the corresponding discovered application and closes all associated application vulnerable items \(AVITs\), keeping your vulnerability inventory accurate without manual cleanup.


## June 2026

The ServiceNow® Vulnerability Response application brings security and IT together to enable you to remediate your most critical vulnerabilities more quickly and efficiently. Vulnerability Response was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Activate the Wiz Asset Integration and identify resource types for import](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/wiz-assets-resources-tab.md)**

    Enhancements to the Wiz integration include:

    -   Starting with version 32.1 \(USEM\) and version 4.1 \(non-USEM\), the Asset integration is deactivated by default and is not a mandatory prerequisite for the other Wiz integration imports.

        If you choose to activate it, the Asset integration will retrieve assets for all resource types if you don't specify the ones you want on the **Asset Integration Configuration** tab. To avoid importing vulnerability data you don't need, identify only the resources \(assets\) that you want to import with this integration.

    -   Resource Type is no longer a mandatory field for configuring the Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz. You can now save Wiz configurations for the integrations without specifying a Resource Type, simplifying setup for use cases where specifying a Resource Type isn't appropriate.
-   **[Enhancement to Vulnerability Response CI lookup rule configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/create-ci-identifier-rules.md)**

    The Applies to field is added to Configuration \(CI\) lookup rule records. For third-party and ServiceNow® integrations that support both Application Vulnerability Response \(AVR\) and Vulnerability Response \(VR\) lookup rules, like the Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz, for example, select one for a rule:

    -   **Discovered Application** for Application Vulnerability Response lookup rules.
    -   **Discovered Item** for Vulnerability Response lookup rules.
    **Note:** The field is left empty by default. If you leave this field empty for lookup rules that support both VR and AVR integrations, background jobs for both applications apply changes on the same set of lookup rules. This state might cause a conflict and set the reapply flag incorrectly. With this distinction set, after the respective background jobs for AVR and VR are completed, the system resets the flag only for the lookup rules for the background job that was run.


## April 2026

The ServiceNow® Vulnerability Response application brings security and IT together to enable you to remediate your most critical vulnerabilities more quickly and efficiently. Vulnerability Response was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[AWS Integration for Security Exposure Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/aws-integration-for-security-exposure-management-overview.md)**

    The AWS Integration for Security Exposure Management supports integrations with the following AWS services:

    -   AWS Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continuously scans EC2 instances, ECR container images, and Lambda functions for software vulnerabilities \(CVEs\) and unintended network exposure. The Vulnerability Response integration with AWS Inspector imports host and container vulnerability findings from AWS Inspector.
    -   AWS Security Hub is a security service that is used to centralize and update security checks across AWS accounts. It provides a unified view of security alerts and compliance status by integrating with various AWS services. The Vulnerability Response integration with AWS Security Hub imports host, container vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations from AWS Security Hub.

## Australia

The ServiceNow® Vulnerability Response application brings security and IT together to enable you to remediate your most critical vulnerabilities more quickly and efficiently. Vulnerability Response was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Unified Microsoft Defender Integration for Security Exposure Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/ms-defender-sem.md)**

    The Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Defender Threat and Vulnerability Management \(MS TVM\) plugins are now consolidated into a single plugin: Microsoft Defender Integration for Security Exposure Management. This consolidation deprecates the standalone Microsoft Defender for Cloud plugin. The unified plugin also introduces container image vulnerability ingestion from Microsoft Defender for Cloud, creating Container Vulnerable Items on your instance. A guided migration path is available to transfer existing data from the deprecated applications to the unified plugin.

-   **[Optimized Tenable.io Compliance Results ingestion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/tenableIntegration.md)**

    Starting with v 6.1.3, the Tenable.io Compliance Results Integration is replaced by the Tenable.io Fixed Compliance Results Integration and Tenable.io Open Compliance Results Integration. Compliance results are now imported based on their status, optimizing ingestion performance and scalability for environments with large volumes of compliance data while keeping remediation and compliance tracking aligned with the current state of findings.

-   **[Qualys Integration – API enhancements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/c_QualysVulnIntegration.md)**

    The Qualys Vulnerability Integration has been upgraded to support newer Qualys API versions across Host Detection, Host List, Knowledgebase, PC Controls, PC Policies, and PCRS integrations. The integrations now ingest additional data fields, including vulnerability detection source, authentication privilege status, active status for controls and policies, and cloud metadata, giving you better visibility into your vulnerability and compliance data. Use the new `posture_api_version` integration instance parameter to choose between the default v2.0 APIs or the newer v5.0 streaming APIs for the PCRS Policy Host and PCRS Test Results integrations.

-   **[Vulnerability Data Management with Central Vulnerability Database \(CVDB\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/cvd-overview.md)**

    The Central Vulnerability Database \(CVDB\) introduces a unified, source-agnostic vulnerability data layer that consolidates data from multiple sources into a single authoritative record, improving accuracy, consistency, and traceability. Key capabilities include:

    -   Unified vulnerability record: Correlates vulnerability data from multiple sources, supports sources including National Vulnerability Database \(NVD\), scanner intelligence, European Union Vulnerability Database, Japanese Vulnerability Database, and vulnerability intelligence feeds.
    -   Priority-based data reconciliation configuration:
        -   Field-level priority: Ensures each attribute \(e.g., CVSS, remediation, exploit status\) can be configured from the most reliable provider.
        -   Source-level priority: Applies a global ranking when field-level rules are not defined.
        -   Hybrid model: Field-level rules take precedence, with source-level fallback; all source data is preserved for full traceability.
    -   Source attribution and traceability: Maintains detailed source metadata, timestamps, and change history to ensure full auditability and transparency.
    -   Data enrichment: Combines CVSS scores, exploit intelligence, and remediation guidance to provide a richer and more actionable vulnerability context.

### What's changed

-   **Vulnerability Response assignment rules**

    The sn\_vul.rerun\_task\_rules system property for rerunning assignment rules was changed to sn\_sec\_rem.rerun\_task\_rules. Users must activate this property \(set to 'true'\) to rerun assignment rules.

-   **[Improved vulnerability assessment workflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/vr-ws-vuln-assessment.md)**
    -   CI filtering for vulnerability assessments: You can now filter which configuration items are included in a vulnerability assessment using a condition builder.
    -   Business Application population on AVITs: AVITs created from SBOM assessment results now include Business Application information, helping you understand application impact and prioritize remediation.
    -   Priority roll‑down from vulnerability assessments: Updates to the priority of a vulnerability assessment now automatically roll down to associated VITs and AVITs, ensuring consistent prioritization based on the highest severity.
-   **[Remediation task rule execution mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/sem-grouping-multiple-findings-remediation-tasks-processing.md)**

    You can now choose how remediation task rules are evaluated during ingestion. The new Match First execution mode evaluates rules sequentially and applies only the first matching rule, assigning each finding to exactly one remediation task. The default Match All mode continues to evaluate all applicable rules.

-   **[Enhanced Compensatory controls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/requesting-approving-risk-reduction.md)**

    When new vulnerable items are ingested and associated with a remediation task that already has an approved compensating control, the reduced risk rating is now automatically inherited by those new vulnerable items.
