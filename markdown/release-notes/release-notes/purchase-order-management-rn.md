## June 2026

The ServiceNow® Purchase Order Management application helps you identify, track, and resolve anomalies or irregularities in the purchase order \(PO\) execution process. Purchase Order Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Support for purchase order confirmation data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/master-data-tables-for-pom.md)**

    Purchase order confirmation and confirmation line tables are available by default when you install the Purchase Order Management plugin, enabling import of this information from external systems. These tables capture supplier acknowledgment and provide buyers visibility into order execution readiness. Note: Integration with external systems is not provided by default.


-   **[Enhancements to the automatic purchase order exception creation from email workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/convert-emails-to-exceptions.md)**

    The Create purchase order exception from email workflow is enhanced to automatically identify purchase order lines. The workflow automatically identifies PO lines when the email contains an ERP PO and PO line ID instead of just a ServiceNow PO line ID. The workflow also supports additional languages \(French, Canadian French, German, Japanese, and Dutch\) for emails. These enhancements help in improving supplier communication and reducing manual intervention.


## Australia Early Availability

The ServiceNow® Purchase Order Management application helps you identify, track, and resolve anomalies or irregularities in the purchase order \(PO\) execution process. Purchase Order Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Automated purchase order exception creation from emails](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/convert-emails-to-exceptions.md)**

    Convert supplier emails into purchase order exceptions when a registered supplier contact sends emails to a supplier inbox. Purchase order exceptions are created for all purchase order queries and assigned to the operational buyer. For queries unrelated to purchase order exceptions, a universal request record is created.


-   **[Identify and execute mitigation strategies for PO exceptions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/mitigation-strategies-for-po-exceptions.md)**

    Use the Define PO exception mitigation strategy agentic workflow to identify and execute mitigation strategies by analyzing delivery gaps and proposing order changes with alternative suppliers.


## Australia

The ServiceNow® Purchase Order Management application helps you identify, track, and resolve anomalies or irregularities in the purchase order \(PO\) execution process. Purchase Order Management was enhanced and updated in the Australia release.

### What's new

-   **[Create purchase order exception from Universal Request](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/create-po-exception-universal-req.md)**

    Enable buyers to convert universal requests that were generated by the Create purchase order exception via email agentic workflow into purchase order exception records. When emails processed by the workflow lack sufficient context to be automatically converted to purchase order exception records, the workflow creates universal request records. After manual review, buyers can turn universal requests into purchase order exception records.


-   **[Create and assign a purchase order exception task](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/assign-a-poe-task-to-a-collaborator.md)**

    Create tasks directly from a purchase order exception and assign these tasks to operational buyers or collaborators. Buyers can also track tasks directly from a purchase order exception.


-   **[Updated visualization of purchase order exceptions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/purch-order-exception-details.md)**

    View the expanded New activity today section on the Purchase order management landing page, reassign exceptions, and view additional details in the Exception intelligence section. Suppliers can also apply filters to purchase order line lists, enabling quick identification of relevant orders.


### What's changed

-   **[Changes in the purchase order exception page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/purch-order-exception-details.md)**

    The New activity today section on the Purchase Order Management landing page has been expanded to list the most recent exceptions and tasks.

    The **Exception intelligence** tab is enhanced to show the supplier spend patterns over time.


### Plugin information

-   **New plugins**

    The following plugin is new in Australia:

    ServiceNow Otto for Purchase Order Management \(POM\) \(sn\_poem\_gen\_ai\): Automates purchase order exception creation and suggests mitigation strategies for order-related issues, helping buyers resolve disruptions quickly and keep procurement operations on track.
