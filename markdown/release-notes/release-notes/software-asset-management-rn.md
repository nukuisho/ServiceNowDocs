## New in the Australia release

-   **Streamline entitlement import by resolving import errors with AI-suggested corrections**

    Reduce manual effort and improve data accuracy when reviewing entitlement import errors in the Software Asset Workspace by using AI skills. When publisher or product names in the standard entitlement import template don't match standard content, the Software normalization and Product match reviewer skills provide AI-suggested corrections for review. The feature also identifies potential duplicate entitlements, enabling you to review and dismiss them where appropriate.

-   **Enhance SaaS application usage monitoring by integrating with the Agent Client Collector for Visibility Content \(ACC-VC\)**

    Monitor SaaS application usage across your organization by using URL monitoring data through the integration of your Software Asset Management application with ACC-VC. The SaaS Detection Report aggregates this usage data and distinguishes managed applications from the unmanaged ones. This enhancement provides actionable visibility to SAM managers into actual SaaS usage for software spend optimization.

    **Note:** The ACC-VC integration with the Software Asset Management application is available with Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management 17.4.0 and later versions.

-   **[ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md)**

    The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you a new AI experience with three licensing tiers available:

    -   Foundation: AI basics to deliver insights
    -   Advanced: AI to boost productivity across relevant use cases
    -   Prime: Act autonomously with all AI assets, and create your own
    Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents.

-   **Improve accuracy and productivity by extracting licensing data from contracts and generating software entitlements**

    Leverage generative AI to upload contract documents and automatically extract licensing data, generating software entitlements. You can review and refine the entitlements prior to finalization. The entitlements are created and linked to the contract records, ensuring a streamlined and accurate process.

-   **Benefit with an integrated troubleshooting experience for SaaS applications by resolving common issues using automated guidance**

    Use generative AI to troubleshoot SaaS integrations with automated guidance and recommendations. By following the resolution guidance, you can significantly reduce downtime, lower the mean time to resolution \(MTTR\), and resolve complex SaaS issues without deep technical intervention.

-   **Use an agentic workflow to automate Microsoft 365 license assignment to users to improve efficiency**

    Use AI agents to assign Microsoft 365 licenses automatically to users on the Microsoft 365 Admin Center without manual intervention. The AI agent analyzes whether there are available licenses and automatically assigns those licenses to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, ensuring accuracy and compliance.

-   **Software Asset Management integration with Contract Management Pro**

    Gain centralized visibility into software contract life cycles and streamline contract management by extracting key metadata and obligations from an uploaded signed contract document using the agentic AI workflow. Additionally, you can optimize costs through proactive tracking of contract renewals, expirations, and contractual obligations by integrating Software Asset Management with the Contract Management Pro application. Note that only Software Asset Management Enterprise users can leverage this functionality.


-   **Improve user activity tracking with the GitHub integration**

    Achieve more accurate user activity data and improved license reclamation for low or no-activity subscriptions by leveraging the enhanced GitHub integration for broader event coverage and extended retention.

-   **Enhanced integration with OpenLM for tracking subscription and consumption licenses**

    Gain improved visibility into engineering application licenses across subscription-based and consumption models with the OpenLM integration. This capability provides support for named user allocation and usage tracking. Additionally, you can better monitor compliance risks and note denial patterns through actionable insights into automated processes and dashboards.

-   **Leverage machine learning \(ML\) normalization for managing your software assets in protected government environments**

    Extend ML normalization capabilities to regulated markets for ServiceNow Protected Platform \(SPP\) in Singapore \(SG\) and Australia \(AU\).

-   **Enhance the security of SAP ABAP on-premise integration using OAuth 2.0 authentication**

    Benefit from enhanced OAuth 2.0 authentication for your SAP ABAP on-premise integrations with improved security. This capability provides a more secure, compliant, and future-proof method for integrating the Software Asset Management application with your SAP systems.

-   **Improve your license management experience through the enhanced support for Oracle WebLogic Suite licensing**

    Access flexible licensing options that align with different deployment models and usage patterns through comprehensive license management with support for the Oracle WebLogic Suite for both Per Processor and Named User Plus \(NUP\) metrics. The enhanced support now covers the entire WebLogic product family, including the flagship Suite edition.

-   **Improve software normalization outcomes with expanded pattern-based normalization rules rule**

    Streamline the software model discovery process by leveraging the expanded pattern-based normalization rule, which eliminates the need to manually update or create new normalization rules for every minor variation in software discovery models. This rule automatically recognizes and matches diverse patterns and variations in software model data. As a result, discovered publisher, product, version, and edition values are seamlessly aligned with the ServiceNow® repository.

-   **Enhanced SQL server enterprise edition license compliance to support Server/CAL licensing model**

    Optimize licensing for legacy Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition licenses under the Server+CAL licensing model with Software Assurance \(SA\) by using the enhanced licensing rule. A single server license can cover up to four virtual machines, provided that the combined processing power for these VMs does not exceed twenty hardware threads or cores at any given time.

-   **Generate optimal software lifecycle reports using a guided playbook that ensures adherence to compliance and audit requirements.**

    Simplify the creation of optimal software life-cycle reports through a guided playbook that assists in defining report scope, identifying gaps, and performing corrective actions. The playbook also integrates with the success portal, enabling you to establish and monitor success metrics, organize tasks and activities, and effectively track progress toward your objectives.

-   **Streamline license management for Microsoft server product Installations and license usage via a single report**

    Gain insights to a unified report for all Microsoft server product installations and license usage across license metrics.
