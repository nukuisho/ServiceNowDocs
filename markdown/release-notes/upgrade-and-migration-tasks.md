[Xanadu Patch 3](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=xanadu-patch-3&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US):

-   After you upgrade to Xanadu Patch 3 from an earlier release, make knowledge block content searchable by reindexing all your indexed sources that include knowledge articles. For details on reindexing, see [Index or reindex an indexed source](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=index-single-source-ais&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US) or [Index or reindex multiple indexed sources](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=index-multiple-sources-ais&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

 Xanadu:

 After you upgrade to Xanadu from an earlier release, perform the following steps to add the Dashboards, data visualizations, and KPIs navigation tabs to global search results in AI Search for Next Experience:

1.  Update the AI Search for Next Experience ServiceNow Store application to version 4 or later. For update instructions, see [Update an application](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_InstallUpdates&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).
2.

Cloud Cost Management 8.0.0

</td><td>

On upgrading to Cloud Cost Management 8.0 version, the new Tag Category **AI Service** is available for Amazon Web Services \(AWS\), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform \(GCP\) service providers. Because Cloud Cost Management executes the Billing Download job only from the current month onwards, the spend on AI services will be included only for the current month. If you want to view the billing details for the months prior to the current month, you must manually execute the Billing Download job. Once the Billing Download job is executed successfully, you can view the spend data of your AI services.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\)

</td><td>

-   Before the upgrade to Xanadu, the ‘Updated CIs’ and ‘Updated application services’ trend lines in the Recent CI activity and Recent application services activities tiles on the Management view in CMDB Workspace, might not have accurately reflected on changes in your system. After upgrading to Xanadu and to versions 5.5, 6.2, or 7.2 of CMDB Workspace, those trend lines will reflect on the more accurate detection of updated CIs and updated application services.
-   CMDB Health:

If either the **CMDB Health Dashboard - Relationship Compliance Processor** or **CMDB Health Dashboard - Relationship Score Calculation** dashboard job is active, that job is deactivated during the upgrade to Xanadu. After the upgrade is complete, you can reactivate those jobs to resume health reports for CI relationships. The active state of all other CMDB Health dashboard jobs is retained.

Any failure threshold for a KPI or metric that is greater than 100,000, is set to 100,000 during upgrade. This upper limit is enforced to avoid excessive processing when a large number of CIs are failing the specified metric tests.

-   Bookmarks for the CI dashboard no longer work after an upgrade to Xanadu. A `Page not found` error message appears. To see CMDB Health reports for a CI, open the CI form in CMDB Workspace.
-   The legacy Application Service Dashboard on Core UI isn't supported in the Xanadu release. After upgrading, you can still access that legacy dashboard by using a previously created bookmark. You can also instead access the Application Services dashboard in CMDB Workspace from the Application services tile in the Insights view in CMDB Workspace.
-   The CMDB Integrations Dashboard on Core UI isn't supported in the Xanadu release. After upgrading, you can still access that legacy dashboard by using a previously-created bookmark.
-   All records that exist in the CMDB Health Result \[cmdb\_health\_result\] table before an update to Xanadu Patch 5, are deleted during the upgrade.

To access a legacy dashboard on an upgraded instance, navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Dashboards** and then search for the dashboard.

Decision tables in Workflow Studio

</td><td>

Workflow Studio is automatically installed on your instance. However, Workflow Studio is a ServiceNow Store application, so to get the latest features, you must update your version manually to the most recent version. As of Washington DC Patch 3, updating Workflow Studio automatically updates all its application dependencies such as Workflow Studio, playbook, and Decision Builder. You can no longer see or update the individual application dependencies of Workflow Studio from the ServiceNow Store or the list of plugins.

DevOps Change Velocity

</td><td>

If you are an upgrading customer, you must run the **ReConfigure Bitbucket Server Repositories for PullRequest** job to re-configure your existing Bitbucket Server or Bitbucket Data Center repositories so that pull request records can be imported. You can navigate to **All &gt; System Definition &gt; Scheduled Jobs** to search for this job and run it.

External Content Connectors

</td><td>

Beginning with version 2 of the External Content Connectors application, external content connectors implement semantic vector indexing for crawled items. When you upgrade to a version that supports semantic vector indexing, your existing connectors will reindex all previously retrieved items the next time they're visited by a crawl, even if those items' content is unchanged. To force semantic vector indexing of your external content items as soon as possible after upgrading, cancel any running crawls, then restart the canceled crawls manually.

Field Service Management

</td><td>

Effective March 1, 2025, Google has designated the Places API, Directions API, and Distance Matrix API as Legacy services. The newer versions of these services are Places API \(New\) and Routes API. You can’t enable or generate new API keys for these legacy services. However, you can continue using these services with the existing API keys. If you need to create a new Google API key after March 1, 2025, you must enable the new APIs from Google Console and upgrade to Xanadu Patch 9 version or higher to ensure compatibility.

After upgrading, users who previously had the fd\_read\_operations role will now see only basic execution details such as the run state and duration. This restriction prevents users with this role from seeing sensitive information in execution details. To provide read access to all execution details such as input configuration and runtime values, grant the user the new role fd\_read\_operations\_all.

MID Server

</td><td>

For the latest MID Server system requirements, see [MID Server system requirements](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=r_MIDServerSystemRequirements&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US). The minimum JRE version supported is 11.0.9 and the recommended version is 11.0.16.1.

 If you have installed your own JRE, the upgrade process takes the following actions to verify that the MID Server uses a supported JRE:

-   If a MID Server is using an unsupported version of the JRE when it upgrades, the upgrade process displays a warning message with the minimum and recommended JRE version.
-   If a supported JRE is running on the MID Server host, the upgraded MID Server uses that version.

 All MID Server host machines require access to the download site at `install.service-now.com` to enable auto-upgrades. For additional details, read how the system manages [MID Server upgrades](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_UpgradeAndTestMIDServer&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

 Only one Windows MID Server service is permitted according to executable path. Upgraded Windows MID Servers that have multiple services pointing to the same installation folder can’t start. See [MID Server fails to start](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=mid-startup-fails&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US) for more information.

 For more information about MID Server upgrades, see the following topics:

-   [MID Server pre-upgrade check](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_UpgradeAndTestMIDServer&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US): Describes how the AutoUpgrade monitor tests the ability of the MID Server to upgrade on your system before the actual upgrade.

Order Management

</td><td>

Features introduced in the Xanadu release aren't supported in earlier releases of Order Management.

 If you’re upgrading from Order Management for Telecommunications and Media version 6.0 or earlier:

-   Starting with the  Washington DC release, the  Monthly Recurring Charges  \(MRC\) and the  Non-Recurring Charges  \(NRC\) for product offerings and product attribute characteristics are no longer stored in the product offering data model. Instead, the MRC and NRC are stored in the Pricing data model in price lists and price list lines. If you want to upgrade your pricing information to use price lists after upgrading to  Washington DC, see the  [Price Management Plugin \(com.sn\_csm\_pricing\) uptake for Telecommunications, Media, and Technology customers upgrading to Washington \[KB1585863\] ](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1585863) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.
-   After upgrading to the  Xanadu release, a fix script runs automatically to deactivate certain telecommunications list records that are no longer needed to resume the capture of an unfinished order. For more information on these records and using the former order capture process, see the  [Deprecating Telco List for Order Capture \[KB1586538\] ](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1586538) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base.

 If you’re an upgrade customer who uses the **contract start date** and **contract end date** fields and has records, you can migrate those records to the latest data model by running the **Migrate data from deprecated contract fields to new fields on Order and Order Lines** scheduled job. This scheduled job must be manually executed by navigating to **System Definitions** &gt; **Scheduled Jobs**.

-   Unattended Robot Login Agent

For more information, see [Download the RPA applications from RPA Hub](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=download-installer-rpa&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

 The following upgrade information is applicable only when you’re upgrading from San Diego or Tokyo to Xanadu.

 Based on the number of records in the application file table, you could experience a potential delay while upgrading the RPA Hub applications from Tokyo or earlier releases to Xanadu.

 Before upgrading RPA Hub to Xanadu, you must set the value of the **glide.rollback.blacklist.TableParentChange.change** system property to **false**. If this property doesn't exist in the System Property \[sys\_properties\] table, add the property and set its value to false. For more information on how to add a property, see [Add a system property](https://servicenow.com/docs/access?context=t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US).

 After you upgrade to Xanadu, the bot process definitions change to the new structure, which is the bot process configuration.

 Although the bot process configuration doesn't replace the bot process completely, most fields are moved from the bot process to the bot process configuration. If you upgrade to Xanadu without updating the system property value, the tables don’t extend the Application File table. To update the table changes manually, see the [Restructuring RPA Hub tables to sys\_metadata in Utah and beyond release](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1223629) article in the Now Support knowledge base.
