This evaluates all ACLs for the current user, so only admin users have the necessary read access to that table. Non-admin users are blocked from fetching chatEnabled, which prevents the chat from functioning for them.

</td><td>

1.  Log in as a non-admin user.
2.  Navigate to an AI Control Tower \(AICT\) page where the chat is expected to load.

Observe that the chat doesn't initialize because chatEnabled can't be fetched.

3.  Log in as an admin user and repeat.

The chat works correctly.


 Expected behavior: ChatEnabled is fetched successfully regardless of the user role.

 Actual behavior: GlideRecord\_query evaluates ACLs and denies non-admin users read access to the deployment channel table.

</td><td>

'Compactor' on RaptorDB creates indexes without 'CONCURRENTLY', causing widespread locks

</td><td>

The DB 'Compactor' job creates direct indexes on temporary tables that are linked with source tables through triggers. Once 'insert' comes in for a source table, the trigger also tries to write on a TMP table, and are blocked by the 'Create index' command.

Creating an index on a few columns with an already existing column causes a drop of the redundant index and a 'AccessExclusiveLock' on a table

</td><td>

 

</td><td>

1.  Ensure that an index already exists on an instance for the ColA.
2.  Create an index on: ColA, ColB, ColC, ColD.
3.  Verify that the redundant index check is dropping the index, causing 'AccessExclusiveLock' and slowness on the instance.

 Expected behavior: It should have been dropped concurrently so that there's no instance wide issue while dropping the index.

 Actual behavior: There's an instance wide issue due to the 'AccessExclusiveLock'.

ColumnName.resurrect\(\) re-shortens long names, corrupting external store column names on deserialization

</td><td>

ColumnName.resurrect\(\) reconstructs a ColumnName from its serialized form using new ColumnName\(name\), which re-applies the preFujiShortColumnName\(\) 30-character shortening algorithm. However, serialize\(\) writes the already-resolved fName directly. For external-store columns \(Snowflake, BigQuery, Trino\) whose physical names exceed 30 characters, the name is corrupted on deserialization — the resurrected ColumnName points to a shortened name that doesn't exist in the external store.

</td><td>

1.  Create a ColumnName with shortening turned off: new Column​Name\('external\_​column\_​with\_​a\_​very\_​long\_​name',​ false\) \(37 chars, exceeds MAX\_LENGTH of 30\).
2.  Serialize via ColumnName.serialize\(writer, cn\).
3.  Deserialize via ColumnName.resurrect\(reader\).

 Observe the resurrected name is the 30 character shortened form, not the original 37 character name — a round-trip corruption.

Edge Encryption

 PRB2012969

</td><td>

Edge Encryption mass jobs do not support sys\_audit table rotation

</td><td>

Edge Encryption mass jobs \(such as mass-encrypt, mass-decrypt, key-rotation\) that process the audited journal field history do not correctly handle instances where the 'sys\_audit' table has been rotated. When sys\_audit is rotated, the historical audit records no longer reside in sys\_audit itself but in one or more physical rotation tables \(for example, sys\_audit0 or sys\_audit1\). Because the job execution infrastructure previously hard-coded sys\_audit as the target table, all direct updates issued during job processing targeted the base sys\_audit table and found no matching records. This results in zero rows being updated for any encrypted field that lives exclusively in a rotated partition.

</td><td>

1.  Configure an Edge Encryption mass job on a table/field whose **Journal** field is audited \(for example, incident.work\_notes with auditing enabled\).
2.  Rotate the sys\_audit table to create physical tables such as sys\_audit0 and sys\_audit1 that contain the actual audit records, and so that the sys\_audit base table is empty.
3.  Run the Edge Encryption mass job, such as mass-encrypt, mass-decrypt, or key-rotation.

 Observe that no audit records are updated, and the job reports zero rows processed for the AUDITED\_NEW\_VALUE and AUDITED\_OLD\_VALUE chunk types. When verifying in the database that encrypted values in sys\_audit0 / sys\_audit1 are unchanged, this confirms updates targeted the empty sys\_audit base table.

Edge Encryption

</td><td>

Edge Encryption mass decryption job doesn't support tables with edge encrypted data inside a field value

</td><td>

There are several tables that end up with edge encrypted data stored inside a field, but where the entire field is not edge encrypted. The user has no way to migrate this data from being edge encrypted. To allow sys\_archive\_log to be used in an edge encryption configuration, the user must add the 'edge\_table\_whitelist=true' attribute to the table in sys\_dictionary. Adding this attribute allows the sys\_archive\_log table to show up in the table list on the edge configuration page.

</td><td>

1.  Create an edge encryption configuration on the **incident.short\_description** field.
2.  Run a mass encryption job to encrypt the data on that field.
3.  Create an archive rule for the incident table to archive one or more of the records with an encrypted **short\_description** field.
4.  Verify that sys\_archive\_log records are created for the archived incidents, and that the **Payload** field has edge encrypted data.
5.  Create an edge encryption rule on **sys\_archive\_log.payload**.
6.  Create an edge decryption job on the sys\_archive\_log table.
7.  Run the job.

 Expected behavior: Edge encrypted data inside the**sys\_archive\_log.payload** field is decrypted by the job.

 Actual behavior: The scheduled encryption job does not have any execution records nor chunks, as it did not find any data to be decrypted.

This is caused by stricter hostname validation logic introduced in Glide's HTTP client layer.

Although the target and source instance hostnames are identical, the platform incorrectly treats them as mismatched, resulting in a java.lang.SecurityException and blocking HLA workflows that rely on fetching /​xmlstats.​do?​include=​services\_​status.​ It breaks the HLA flow responsible for retrieving elastic endpoints and other service status information.

</td><td>

The Guided Tour does not populate route parameters for 'default' dashboards, which breaks the functionality

</td><td>

By default, when navigating to 'now/​platform-​analytics-​workspace/​dashboards' and selecting a dashboard, the system will set the last dashboard that was viewed as the default' dashboard. This dashboard will always be displayed when navigating to the same page until the user views a different dashboard, at which point, that dashboard will then become the 'default'. In addition to this, when creating a new guided tour using a URL, the system auto-creates a sys\_embedded\_tour\_guide record and uses the values from the URL to populate the 'Context' and **Route parameters** fields. However, when a tour is created using the URL for a 'default' dashboard, no URL parameters are needed, and the system sets the 'Route parameters' value to empty \(\{\}\). If a user visits another dashboard, which will automatically set that dashboard as the 'default', the system attempts to run the same guided tour created for the previous default dashboard, and fails.

</td><td>

1.  Set a 'default' dashboard.
2.  Navigate to the URL: **now/​platform-​analytics-​workspace/​dashboards**.
3.  Navigate to any dashboard from the drop-down list menu, such as 'AI Agent Analytics'.
4.  Navigate back to the URL: **now/​platform-​analytics-​workspace/​dashboards**.
5.  Confirm the the last dashboard viewed is the dashboard that is displayed on the page.
6.  Copy the URL to the dashboard that is displayed.
7.  Created a guided tour for the default dashboard.
8.  Confirm it works as expected.
9.  Navigate to **Guided Tour Designer** &gt; **Create Tour**.

11. Create and publish the tour with example steps.
12. Navigate to **sys\_embedded\_tour\_guide.list**.
13. Open the record for the tour that was created.
14. Confirm that the context is 'now/​platform-​analytics-​workspace/​dashboards' and the 'Route Parameters' value is empty \(\{\}\).
15. Navigate to **now/​platform-​analytics-​workspace/​dashboards**.
16. Confirm the default dashboard displays.

20. Navigate to **now/​platform-​analytics-​workspace/​dashboards**.

23. Confirm the tour launches.

 Notice the tour fails, or crashes. This is due to the tour targets elements on the previous default dashboard. Since no URL parameters were saved as it was the default, the system cannot locate those elements on the new default dashboard, causing the failures.

Create record form not rendering when show\_create\_record\_form value is missing on record generator

The 'Create record' form fails to render on a playbook card when the record generator does not have a value populated for 'show\_create\_record\_form'. The expected behavior is that the form should render by default \(treating an absent value as true\), with the form only being hidden when 'show\_​create\_​record\_​form.​value' is explicitly set to '0'. Today, configurations that pre-date the 'show\_create\_record\_form' property or that omit it for any reason end up with no form rendered, which is a regression from the original always-show behavior.

 Steps to reproduce:

 1.  Trigger the ACR local login flow for a user who has the admin role but does NOT have sso\_config\_admin explicitly assigned.
2.  Execution reaches ACRUtil.isACRUserByUserID\(\) before session is established.
3.  Internally, call user.hasRole\(&lt;any\_role&gt;\) on the User object retrieved for the login candidate.

 Expected behavior: HasRole\(\) returns true, reflecting actual DB role membership.

Dependent choices filter on a session domain instead of a record domain

</td><td>

When glide.​sys.​domain.​use\_​record\_​domain\_​for\_​choice\_​list is true, the choice list resolution through GlideElement.getChoices\(\) is expected to filter choices based on the record's domain instead of the session domain. This works correctly for non-dependent choice fields. However, dependent choice fields \(for example, subcategory, which depends on category\) filter based on the session domain, ignoring the record's domain — even when the property is enabled. This means when a global user accesses choices on a record belonging to a child domain, the category returns the correct domain-specific choices, but the subcategory returns global choices or nothing.

Credentials containing org level projects.list role cause total interval failure

</td><td>

When the GCP Trace Collector uses a service account with org-level project listing permission but trace/log access only for some projects, the collector fails the entire pipeline on the first unauthorized project. This causes the circuit breaker to trigger and results in data loss, even for projects where access is valid.

</td><td>

2.  Grant an org/folder-level role that includes resourcemanager.projects.list \(for example, roles/browser\).
3.  Grant Cloud Trace / Logs permissions to only one project.
4.  Configure and run the GCP Trace Collector with this service account.

 Expected behavior: Skip only the projects where trace access is missing. Continue fetching traces from projects with valid permissions. Do not fail the entire pipeline due to partial access.

 Actual behavior: Projects are listed successfully and trace fetch starts, but on the first unauthorized project a PERMISSION\_DENIED error occurs. Circuit breaker triggers and the interval is skipped.

A stale Interaction Record sysID is passed for the help request modal component

</td><td>

This issue is caused when a modal is opened from the utility panel. The utility panel gets hoisted from the screen to the appshell and loses the context of the screen. When the first utility panel gets hoisted, there's no issue because the modal logic falls back to the first matching element with the modal component ID. When an additional screen with a utility panel is opened, and an action is taken to open a new modal, the context of the screen is lost and the modal fallback logic is executed.

All auto chat conversations share the same conversation because the channel user profile reuse ignores channelUserId

</td><td>

All auto chat records reference the same conversation.

</td><td>

1.  Configure a channel with a provider application that supports bot-to-bot / auto chat conversations.
2.  Trigger multiple auto chat conversations for the same user on that channel, each with a unique channelUserId passed in the AI agent context.
3.  Wait for all auto chat executions to complete.
4.  Open the auto chat records and inspect the conversation field on each record.

 Expected behavior: Each auto chat record has a unique conversation.

 Actual behavior: All auto chat records reference the same conversation — the one tied to the first channel user profile found for that user on that channel.

Connections tab in the Service Exchange Center.

 Create, view, request, and offboard provider and consumer connections from a single location in the Service Exchange Center. Search and filter connections without navigating across multiple screens.

 Improved consumer registration and onboarding.

 Onboard consumers faster with a guided, step-by-step registration experience. Upgraded consumers are automatically redirected to this experience to receive clearer progress indicators during onboarding, and actionable messaging for failure and delay scenarios, minimizing onboarding friction and support dependency.

 Improved FDS capabilities.

 -   Improve your connection experience, by syncing Knowledge Base articles between provider and consumer instances.
-   Reduce data inconsistencies by maintaining sys IDs for CMDB data and dependent relationships through transform maps.
-   Ensure CI functionality is preserved on the destination instance by choosing to automatically create CI dependency relationships when relationship data is received from the source.
-   Improved compliance through restricted data sync from non production instances to production instances for CMDB tables.

 Journal Field Framework enhancements.

 -   Increase flexibility in journal data synchronization between provider and consumer instances by mapping multiple source fields to a single target journal field.
-   Configure journal fields such of type journal\_input fields alongside journal type, ensuring all journal entries are preserved during synchronization without requiring custom scripting.

 Group-based persona assignments for Remote Catalog.

Automate Task Mining tasks in Automation Center.

 Automation Center transforms task recordings from Task Mining, decomposes them into discrete automations, and generates an AI agent in AI Agent Studio that executes those automations using AI Desktop Actions.

 Automation Center analyzes Task Mining recordings and identifies discrete tasks-on-screen actions and background actions-eliminating manual analysis and reducing time-to-automation from hours to minutes.

 This multi-tool solution ensures that any repetitive task in Task Mining can be automated to be run as desktop actions.This feature currently supports only Excel-to-browser interactions, where data is copied from a Microsoft Excel file and is entered into a form in a browser.

 You must have the User Task Summarization skill and Now Assist AI Agents skill activated to use this feature.

 Task Mining recording and AI Desktop Actions agent execution require a Windows machine.For detailed information, see the Automation Center documentation.

 Kanban Board Enhancements.

 Create tasks from the Request board in Kanban board. Earlier, you could create tasks only from the Task Board in Kanban board. Also, there's a contextual panel to the right of the Kanban board that helps you create a task.

Restore to any point in your workflow, including manual edits between Build Agent prompts, and the system intelligently manages update set reconciliation to keep your change history clean and traceable.
-   Build Agent handles checkpoints and update sets differently: checkpoint 0 no longer creates an update set, checkpoint 1 is the base update set for all subsequent changes, and update sets use human-readable naming.
-   An updated semantic metadata search tool improves performance replaces the previous semantic search tool.

Data Foundation Model

</td><td>

1.11.0

</td><td>

New AI digital assets are now automatically assigned a unique, human-readable asset tag. Each tag follows the format of a type prefix followed by a hash value, where the prefix identifies the kind of asset, as listed here. Records that don't belong to one of these asset types are skipped and receive no tag.

 -   AIS - AI Systems.
-   AIM - AI Models.
-   AIP - AI Prompts.
-   AID - AI Datasets.
-   MCP - MCP assets.

 Tags are generated deterministically so that the same asset always produces the same tag. The value is derived from a stable identifier on the record, using the ServiceNow reference ID first, falling back to the external reference ID, and finally the record's own sys\_id if neither is present. That identifier is hashed using a 64-bit FNV-1a algorithm and rendered as a zero-padded 20-digit number, which is then combined with the type prefix. The tag is written back to the record without altering audit fields or re-triggering workflows, avoiding unnecessary updates and recursion.

 Tagging happens in two ways:

 -   New assets are tagged automatically by a business rule that fires immediately after the record is inserted.
-   Existing untagged assets are handled by an on-demand scheduled job that finds records with an empty asset tag and backfills them, logging its progress along the way.

ITOM - Prime

</td><td>

1.1.0

</td><td>

ITOM - Prime provides the following capabilities:

 -   AI agents for AIOps - Automate alert triage, impact analysis, and root cause investigation with an AI-driven agentic workflow that transforms manual operator processes, typically 30+ clicks and 15+ minutes, into a streamlined, autonomous flow. The workflow processes incoming IT alerts end-to-end, correlating observability data, analyzing affected services, and identifying probable root causes before an operator touches the alert. Consolidated insights are surfaced through the Express List interface, giving operators immediate visibility into what happened, what's affected, and recommended next steps, enabling faster resolution while keeping humans in control of final decisions.
-   AI agents for Observability - Helps IT operators assess business and application service impact, formulate probable cause theories, and prioritize investigations by analyzing data from ServiceNow and seamlessly collaborating with third-party AI agents from leading APM and observability vendors, including New Relic, Dynatrace, and Kentik. Using natural language, IT operators can understand the blast radius of an alert, pinpoint affected services, assess business impact, formulate probable cause theories, and help track down the right teams to drive towards problem resolution.
-   AIOps Learning Enhanced Automation Playbooks - Leverages AI-driven insights to mine historical incident data, dynamically prioritize tasks, and generate actionable resolution playbooks. By automating workflows and enhancing knowledge sharing, AIOps Learning Enhanced Automation Playbooks empowers teams to address issues proactively and efficiently. It reduces mean time to resolution \(MTTR\), increases automation coverage, streamlines processes like certificate renewals, and improves team productivity. This ultimately leads to measurable cost savings and operational excellence.

Automate Task Mining tasks in Automation Center.

 Automation Center transforms task recordings from Task Mining, decomposes them into discrete automations, and generates an AI agent in AI Agent Studio that executes those automations using AI Desktop Actions.

 Automation Center analyzes Task Mining recordings and identifies discrete tasks-on-screen actions and background actions-eliminating manual analysis and reducing time-to-automation from hours to minutes.

 This multi-tool solution ensures that any repetitive task in Task Mining can be automated to be run as desktop actions.This feature currently supports only Excel-to-browser interactions, where data is copied from a Microsoft Excel file and is entered into a form in a browser.

 You must have the User Task Summarization skill and Now Assist AI Agents skill activated to use this feature.

 Task Mining recording and AI Desktop Actions agent execution require a Windows machine.For detailed information, see the Automation Center documentation.

Now Assist in AI Search

</td><td>

New

 AI Search Admins can now configure any search source \(including non-out-of-box tables such as incidents and custom tables\) to the Now Assist multi-content synthesized answers. Results from additional sources are dispatched per source group, merged into a ranked top-K list, and delivered to the synthesizer with citation metadata and origin information intact. New system properties control the maximum documents requested per group and the top-K document count used in the final merged response.

 Changed

 Search and VA profile handling has been separated for the Enhanced Chat dynamic window experience.

 Fixed

 -   MarkdownToHtml incorrectly truncated URLs containing balanced parentheses. For example, SharePoint URLs containing \(SRM FORM\) caused the href attribute to cut off at the first closing parenthesis and left the remainder of the URL as plain text in Now Assist synthesized answer rendering.
-   The Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Model returned an inconsistent output structure \(one synthesized result plus separate citation entries\) rather than consolidating citations within the synthesized result as an internal array. This caused multiple Genius Guidance Cards to render instead of a single unified card.

What's new?.

 -   Conversations - A dedicated view of chat activity from chat assistants like Now asisst virtual agent, including total chat users, live agent transfers, and the full sequence of chat events from conversation start to response. Analyze trends over time and drill into any individual conversation.
-   Cross-application conversion funnels - Build funnels where each step can belong to a different application, so you can follow a user journey as it spans multiple workspaces and portals.
-   Session-based and user-based funnels - Choose whether steps must complete within one session \(time-to-value\) or across multiple sessions over time \(overall task completion\).
-   Previous period comparison in conversion funnel - Compare completion rate, step conversion, and transition timing against a prior period. Each metric shows its delta, and a step comparison table breaks down engaged users, sessions, and conversion time side by side - turning a snapshot into an adoption trend.
