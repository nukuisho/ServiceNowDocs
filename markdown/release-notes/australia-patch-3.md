## Changes in Australia Patch 3

-   **[Activate a pre-release feature](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/activate-prerelease-feature.md)**

    Activate a pre-release feature on the instance so your users can try it out and provide feedback to the product team.

-   **[Activate Data snapshots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/activate-unlimited-breakdowns.md)**
    -   Starting with Australia Patch 3, if the instance is eligible, this plugin is installed automatically.
    -   Activate Data snapshots for each eligible indicator, either one-at-a-time or in bulk.
-   **[Authentication release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/authentication-rn.md)**
    -   Email OTP as an authentication factor for AI voice service: Use Email OTP as a standalone factor, a primary factor, or a secondary factor in AI voice agent authentication flows. When a caller reaches the voice agent, a one-time password is sent to their registered email address. The caller provides the password to complete authentication.
    -   KBA for AI voice service: Use the KBA setup to configure Knowledge-Based Authentication \(KBA\) for the voice channel. Choose from base system questions at both the identification level and the authentication level. AI voice service mappings are populated automatically from your Assistant Designer selection, so manually mapping voice services is no longer a mandatory step in the KBA setup.
    -   Authenticate callers at the start of every call: Prompt callers for authentication or identification details at the start of every call, before the voice-only assistant responds to any request, using the Authenticate at the start of the call option on the Assistant Designer's Caller verification page.
-   **[Clone Admin Console release notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/clone-admin-console-rn.md)**

Instance scan jobs triggered by the Access Auditor Suite, which is a part of the Access Analyzer \(sn\_access\_analyzer\) store application, may hang or fail to terminate. This may cause multiple jobs to accumulate over several days, consuming multiple workers and preventing other jobs from running. This may cause performance issues on the instance. This issue affects Access Analyzer \(sn\_access\_analyzer\) versions 6.0.0 through 6.0.5, as well as version 6.1.0.

Navigation fails for sources beyond sliding windows in an activity stream

</td><td>

When selecting a citation source in an incident summary response, navigation doesn't work properly if the cited activity \(comment or email\) is more than three pages away or above the current activity stream view. The user receives a message stating 'The source may be hidden in your current view', even though the source exists and isn't filtered.

</td><td>

1.  Navigate to any instance on track/anowassist.
2.  Open Service Operations Workspace.
3.  Open a record with 200+ activity stream entries.
4.  Scroll to a recent AI-generated response containing citation references.
5.  Select **Show sources**.

The cited source \(comment/email\) should be an older entry — at least 3+ pages above the current viewport.

AI skill attribution issue in an activity stream

</td><td>

Activity stream entry grouping logic should account for AI skills registered via setValueWithAuditIdentity. The grouping currently does not use sys\_updated\_by as the grouping key when UserAgentContext isn't set, so field-level audit entries attributed to distinct AI skill sys IDs along with the session user involved are not getting shown as expected.

Unguarded Jelly expression in form.xml causes RhinoEcmaError warnings on every classic form load

</td><td>

On any classic UI16 form load, the platform Jelly template evaluator throws a RhinoEcmaError warning in the system log. The warning is present on every classic form, regardless of application scope or record type. There is no functional outage; forms load and save correctly, and all transactions return HTTP 200 with normal response times. The main impact is high-volume system log noise.

</td><td>

1.  Log in to a Zurich instance.
2.  Open any classic UI16 form record without a sysparam\_citation query parameter in the URL.

Example without activity stream: Navigate to /sys\_dictionary.do and open any record.

Example with activity stream: Navigate to /incident.do and open any record.

3.  After the form loads, open the system log.

 Expected behavior: No RhinoEcmaError warnings are generated during a standard form load.

 Actual behavior: On forms without an activity stream, one warning entry is generated per form load. On forms with an activity stream, two warning entries are generated per form load.

4.  Run the 'Record Summarization' skill.
5.  Select a citation source that points to an activity stream entry.
6.  Log out of the instance.
7.  Log back in to the instance and return to the same record.

 Expected behavior: The citation URL shouldn't be preserved after triggering the citation source flow.

 Actual behavior: The URL that is created after selecting a citation source is preserved, and causes the citation scroll and highlight to trigger.

Enhanced updateSegment API \(wrap-up\) to support agent-initiated wrap-up

</td><td>

As a CCaaS Developer, the updateSegment API should be able to be used in the CCaaS plugin. This API should allow users to update a wrap-up segment at the same time as closing/updating the segment without requiring a separate API call. This allows the voice plugin to support agent-initiated wrap-up. Agents should have the ability to initiate a wrap-up before the call ends. If the system has wrap-up with a timer, they should get a timer on the wrap-up modal to provide the count down timer until the wrap-up is submitted.

Agent Chat

 PRB1992614

</td><td>

Dirty screens in Document Object Model \(DOM\) experience data loss if one of the middle tabs are closed, triggering a screen reorder and refresh

</td><td>

Screens between deleted screens lose edited data due to incorrect DOM detachment/reattachment. When incident is closed, screens 2 and 4 are removed. The updateChildren algorithm uses two-pointer comparison \(from both ends\). Elements at the ends that match are patched in place, but elements in the middle that need repositioning are moved via insertBefore. This movement triggers a re-render of sn-canvas-screen, and due to vnode-DOM desynchronization \(the view renders a p but loadScreen manually replaces it with the macroponent\), the section element is destroyed and recreated. This causes hook-insert to fire, which calls loadScreen again, recreating the macroponent and losing all unsaved data.

</td><td>

1.  Open the Service Operations Workspace list URL.
2.  Navigate to an incident list.
3.  Open any incident.
4.  Select the **+** menu.
5.  Select **Create Interaction**.
6.  Edit the new interaction record fields.
7.  Navigate to an incident record.

Add 'None' choice to the **rm\_epic.status** field and make it the default for new epics

The **Epic Status** field \(rm\_epic.status\) currently doesn't include a 'No status' option, which prevents epics from having an unset/neutral status. This causes ambiguity in reporting and makes it difficult to distinguish between epics that have not yet been assigned a status versus those intentionally marked as green, yellow, or red.

When running AutoEval for the Enterprise Architecture Explorer – Query Agent, the evaluation run gets stuck indefinitely while processing certain questions and datasets. During execution, AutoEval doesn't progress to completion, progress keeps retrying without advancing, and the run never completes successfully. GenAI logs repeatedly show: 'JSON\{ "facts": \[\]\}Show more lines'. Despite retries, no new facts are generated and the evaluation pipeline makes no forward progress.

Chat gate service uses a GlideRecord query with ACL evaluation, blocking non-admin users from reading the 'Deployment channel' table

</td><td>

In chat-gate-service.js \(line 13\), the chatEnabled check uses glideRecord\_query to query the 'Deployment channel' table. This evaluates all ACLs for the current user, so only admin users have the necessary read access to that table. Non-admin users are blocked from fetching chatEnabled, which prevents the chat from functioning for them.

ColumnName.resurrect\(\) re-shortens long names, corrupting external store column names on deserialization

However, serialize\(\) writes the already-resolved fName directly.

In this scenario, the reference fields are already correctly defined, and recalculating their length based on display values is unnecessary and incorrect.

'Run once' Data Privacy jobs take a long time to complete on large tables

</td><td>

As part of Zurich, Data Privacy jobs were enhanced to support incremental and recurring anonymization. As part of this, 'sys\_updated\_on &lt; jobStartTime' was added to the query condition while creating segments and querying a batch of records for processing. Generally, sys\_updated\_on column isn't indexed. As a result, the jobs take lot of time to create segments, which require querying boundary records involving filtering on sys\_updated\_on and ordering by sys\_id. While the sys\_updated\_on filter condition is necessary to support incremental, this dependency can be removed on 'Run once' jobs, where all records in a table are expected to be anonymized.

</td><td>

1.  Provision an instance with the Data Privacy plugin installed on a large clone.
2.  Set up a privacy configuration on a table with large number of records.
3.  Configure and run a 'Run once' dp\_job.

 Expected behavior: Segment creations \(dp\_work\_item\) should happen within few a minutes.

A minimum segment size of 100K characters restricts parallelization and lacks work item table cleanup

</td><td>

The current minimum segment size is hardcoded at 100K characters, which artificially caps the number of segments that can be generated for a given dataset. As a result, the number of worker threads that can be utilized for parallel processing is also restricted — even when additional infrastructure capacity \(CPU, memory, available workers\) is available to be consumed. If the minimum segment size is reduced to improve parallelization, the number of work items inserted into dp\_workitem grows significantly, accelerating the rate at which this table accumulates rows. Without a corresponding cleanup mechanism, this will lead to unbounded table growth, increased storage consumption, and potential degradation of query performance over time.

</td><td>

Instance scan jobs get stuck in a sleep loop for days, which causes the subsequent scans to fail

</td><td>

Instance scan findings are written to the database asynchronously and are tracked using a global counter. If any write fails, the counter doesn't decrement properly; it goes up but never comes back down. This causes all future scans to hang indefinitely, waiting for a counter that will never reach zero. There's no timeout or logging to flag this, so scans can get stuck silently.

Affects users using IT and HR products on the same instance. Due to the data internal visibility/governance policies, users have removed a number of HR roles \(i.e. 'sn\_hr\_core.admin' role\) from the admin role, resulting in users in the IT business units not having access to the HR side of the platform. Removing the roles from the admin profile prevents the 'system' user from executing the AutoResolution scripts includes. The 'system' user no longer has access to the HR tables of the instance, hence it can't extract the necessary information for auto resolution ML Configuration Language solution, auto resolution context, or write to HR records.

There's unintended creation of temporary list copies when refreshing a default list via address bar

</td><td>

When a user refreshes a default list by selecting the browser address bar and pressing Enter, the system creates a new temporary copy of the list and stores it under 'My Lists' &gt; 'Opened by link'.

In AttachmentMigrationService, copy-then-delete causes silent data loss through cascade delete on sys\_attachment\_attribute, dp\_attachment\_protection\_history, and sys\_attachment\_migration\_status

</td><td>

AttachmentMigrationService migrates attachments between the storage backends 'ROWSTORE' and 'COLUMNSTORE' by creating a new sys\_attachment row with a new sys\_id, and then deleting the old one. Deleting the old sys\_attachment triggers reference\_cascade\_rule='delete' on every child table that references it, which silently destroys records that reference the old sys\_id, even though a valid replacement exists. The cascade engine has no knowledge of the new sys\_id, so the new sys\_attachment ends up with no associated child rows. The following child tables suffer silent data loss on every migrated attachment: sys\_attachment\_attribute \(per-attachment metadata\), sys\_attachment\_migration\_status \(migration tracking history\), and dp\_attachment\_protection\_history \(data-privacy / compliance audit trail\).

</td><td>

1.  Open an instance with the columnar attachments plugin, 'com.glide.data\_ management.columnar \_attachments,' enabled.
2.  Create a sys\_attachment row for any storage type, such as 'ROWSTORE', and note that the sys\_id equals 'X'.
3.  Insert child rows referencing 'X' with the following:
    1.  sys\_attachment \_attribute: row with the sys\_attachment = X
    2.  sys\_attachment \_migration\_status: row with the attachment = X
    3.  dp\_attachment \_protection\_history: row with the attachment = X
4.  Trigger the migration via AttachmentMigration Service.migrate Attachments\(\[X\], AttachmentStorageType .ROWSTORE, AttachmentStorageType .COLUMNSTORE\).
5.  Query each of the three child tables for the original sys\_id 'X' after the call returns.

 Expected behavior: All three child tables still contain rows for the migrated attachment, either against the same sys\_id, or under copy-then-delete which is re-pointed to the new sys\_id.

 Actual behavior: All three child tables contain zero rows for the original sys\_id 'X'. The new sys\_attachment record, the new sys\_id 'Y', exists with the migrated chunk data, but contains no rows in any of these three child tables. The data is silently lost and no error is logged. This occurs in any instance running on a build that includes AttachmentMigrationService for track, datamanagement, and downstream.

Correlation Insights skill is stuck on the progress bar when off-Glide is enabled

</td><td>

Insights should be generated and displayed. Instead, the progress bar spins indefinitely and no generative AI logs are produced. The issue occurs because the app prepares a bulk request with three payloads and invokes it in async mode with a callback handler. When off-glide is enabled for the capability, the async callback flow \('NowAssistforSIR CorrelationInsights Callback'\) appears to break silently. No generative AI logs are generated, indicating the LLM call never completes or the response isn't handled correctly.

Off-glide Mosaic pipeline ignores the per-request timeout and every call falls back to the platform default, regardless of caller intent or service-plan configuration

</td><td>

All Mosaic calls fall back to the platform default; caller / control-setting / service-plan values are ignored. There's no phase-boundary timeout enforcement and requests run well past their stated SLA. DT translation always uses 0L.

</td><td>

1.  Enable off-Glide execution.
2.  Ensure the Mosaic endpoint is reachable.
3.  Submit an off-Glide execution request with an explicit short timeout \(e.g., 5 seconds\) that targets a capability with a slow model/heavy prompt so that the Mosaic call takes around 10–20 seconds.

Observe that the request doesn't abort at 5 seconds. It runs until the platform default \(around 60 seconds\) or the upstream gateway times out.

4.  In the Mosaic-client logs, confirm timeoutMs=0 \(or the default\) on the outgoing HTTP call, regardless of the caller-supplied value.
5.  Update the sys\_generative\_ai control setting \(Mosaic timeout\) to a small value.
6.  Send a request with no explicit timeout.

Observe that the control setting is also ignored.

7.  Update one\_api\_service\_plan.timeout\_ms for the plan backing the capability.
8.  Send a request.

Observe that the service-plan value is not applied either.

9.  Pick a capability whose postprocessor emits a \_dtRequest \(DT reverse translation\).
10. Send a request with timeout=5 seconds where the primary Mosaic call returns at around 4 seconds.
11. Confirm the subsequent DT-translation call still fires with timeoutMs=0 \(platform default\), so the total elapsed time exceeds 5 seconds.
12. Repeat steps 9-11, driving the budget to exhaustion before postprocess.
13. Confirm the DT call still fires instead of being skipped, and there is no 400001 / timeout response.
14. Send a request via the routed-from-Mosaic &gt; OneExtend callback path \(validateOffGlideConfig\) that triggers DT translation.
15. Confirm that no timeout is honored there either.

 Expected behavior: The caller-supplied timeout is the strongest signal and is honored by every Mosaic HTTP call in the pipeline \(preprocess gate, primary execute, postprocess DT translation\). In its absence, the control-setting, service-plan, and 60 second default apply \(in that order\). Exhausting the budget at any phase returns a timeout response \(status=error, errorCode=400001\). Override values are persisted to one\_api\_service\_ plan.timeout\_ms and cascade.

 Actual behavior: All Mosaic calls fall back to the platform default; caller / control-setting / service-plan values are ignored. There's no phase-boundary timeout enforcement and requests run well past their stated SLA. DT translation always uses 0L.

When a custom declarative action is configured with the action model set to 'Playbook Card' in order to display a button on a playbook activity, the expected behavior after displaying an error is as follows: if the UI action invoked by the declarative action displayed an error message, the error was displayed to the user, and the underlying activity was not marked as complete.

When the UI action returns an error message, the error is displayed to the user; however, the activity is also marked as complete.

Add a 'No status' option to the **Project status** field

</td><td>

The **Project status** field \(pm\_project.status\) currently doesn't include a 'No status' option, which prevents projects from having an unset/neutral status state. This causes ambiguity in reporting and makes it difficult to distinguish between projects that have not yet been assigned a status versus those intentionally marked as 'On Track' or 'At Risk'. A 'No status' option should be added to the **Status** field choice list. This ensures that status transitions — including from an unset state to a defined status — can be accurately captured and reflected in usage analytics.

</td><td>

Record Hierarchy

 PRB2014979

</td><td>

Allow RecordHierarchies to always be usable optionally unless it is disabled

</td><td>

The current behavior shows that after a record hierarchy is defined, any query operations that use the hierarchy will explicitly return 'false' until every record in the hierarchy has been assigned a path. After paths have been assigned, the hierarchy is said to be 'usable' as its fully initialized and ready for queries. A GP was added to optionally allow the hierarchy to be usable while records are being assigned paths. The results for queries may be incomplete or partially stale depending on how long the initialization takes place, but should otherwise be accurate. Users are beginning to use IN\_HIERARCHY conditions for all sorts of features ranging in criticality, up to and including ACLs. If the record hierarchy runs into some sort of issue, such as it can render the record hierarchy unusable and all queries would begin to fail. However, the paths assigned to all records are still valid as long as changes are minimal, and can continue to return mostly accurate results while any issues with the record hierarchy feature are addressed. This fix is to address usability; as long as the record hierarchy isn't explicitly deactivated, it can be made 'usable' and queries will return results based on whatever paths may be assigned at the time.

Cost plan breakdowns are duplicated

</td><td>

When the user changes the start date and end date from a resource plan, the business rule \(BR\) UpdateCostPlanAssociatedToResourcePlan launches an event. The BR 'Recreate Requested Allocations' is also launched, updating the resource plan again and changing the planned cost. In summary, when the user updates the dates, the system updates the resource plan twice, one time for the dates and another for the planned cost, practically at the same time. Both changes trigger the BR UpdateCostPlanAssociatedToResourcePlan and two events are created. Since there are two events in the system, they will try to perform the same action, and this could lead to problem concurrency. The two events are processed at the same time and the cost plan breakdowns are created twice.

Both setDiscoveryModelNormalizedValues\(\) and findSuggestedValues\(\) used ruleObj.productType directly \(which comes from samp\_sw\_product.product\_type\) bypass product license exception rules. Other normalization paths \(pattern, package map\) already consult these exception rules via NormalizationEngine.\_getProductTypeFromRule\(\).

</td><td>

1.  Create a product in samp\_sw\_product with the product\_type=licensable.
2.  Create a product license exception rule for that product with a specific edition mapped to 'not licensable'.
3.  Create a regex normalization rule pointing to that product.
4.  Create a discovery model whose display\_name matches the Regex pattern with the exception edition.
5.  Run the 'SAM - Normalize Discovery Models Using Content Rules' job.

 Expected behavior: The discovery model's norm\_type should be 'not licensable' \(honoring the Product License Exception Rule\), consistent with how pattern and package map normalization paths behave via \_getProductTypeFromRule\(\).

 Actual behavior: The discovery model's norm\_type is set to 'licensable' \(taken directly from samp\_sw\_product.product\_type\). The same issue affects the suggestions path — findSuggestedValues\(\) also returns the wrong productType, causing incorrect suggested values.

The 'Apply latest content changes' job fails for Regex normalization rules due to calling a private function as an instance method

</td><td>

SampRegexNormalization RuleContentUpdate Handler.reEvaluate DiscoveryModels\(\) calls this.regexEngine. buildRuleObject\(ruleGr\), but buildRuleObject is a closure-private function inside RegexNormalizationEngine's IIFE — it isn't exposed as an instance method. This causes every content update for Regex rules to crash.

</td><td>

1.  Ensure the Regex normalization feature is active \(com.sn\_itam\_samp plugin\).
2.  Have at least one Regex normalization rule record in the samp\_regex\_ normalization\_rule table.
3.  Trigger the 'Apply latest content changes' scheduled job, or invoke SampRegexNormalization RuleContentUpdate Handler.processRecord\(\) on a Regex rule record.

 See that the job fails with an error: 'Cannot find function buildRuleObject in object \[object Object\]'.

Virtual Agent Web Client

 PRB1993741

</td><td>

When live\_agent\_only is set to true, the agent chat triggers the greetings topic instead of going to the live agent

</td><td>

The /esc portal agent chat is configured to only trigger the live agent. However, when the user selects the 'Virtual Agent' icon, it triggers the greetings topic and doesn't go to the live agent. When the user ends the first conversation and creates another conversation, it then goes straight to the live agent. The issue only occurs the first time the user selects the 'Virtual Agent' icon in the session. It also only happens for Now Assist virtual agent sessions.

</td><td>

1.  Enable Now Assist in Virtual Agent.
2.  Configure the agent chat configuration for the /esc portal.
3.  Turn off all the other agent chat configurations, only keeping one active.
4.  Navigate to /esc.
5.  Select the **Virtual Agent** icon.

 Expected behavior: It triggers the live agent support topic.

 Actual behavior: It triggers the greetings topic. However, if you end the conversation and create a conversation, it goes straight to the live agent.

Sybase Discovery failed due to an issue in the step 8 condition, causing instances to be created in the wrong class

</td><td>

The Sybase Discovery pattern fails during execution, which results in database instances created in the parent table instead of the expected Sybase-specific class. Even after retrieving the instance name in step 7, the Sybase database pattern is failing in step 8.

Flat table records aren't invalidated when location attributes are inserted to Workforce Operations \(WFO\) events

</td><td>

In Australia, when a location attribute \(sn\_shift\_planning \_sched\_attr\) record was inserted into or deleted from a WFO event, the related schedule flat-table records weren't invalidated. As a result, outdated event entries continued to exist on the agent's flat table instead of being re-inserted with the updated sn\_shift\_planning\_ sched\_attr sys\_id. The issue was present in the 'Update schedule flat table' business rule in the Field Service Management \(com.snc.work\_management\) plugin.

</td><td>

1.  Enable WFO.
2.  Insert a location attribute \(sn\_shift\_planning\_sched\_attr\) record to a WFO event.
3.  Navigate to a flat table.

 See the outdated events record still exist for the agent. When sn\_shift\_planning\_sched\_attr record is inserted or deleted, related flat table records should also be invalidated as they have to be inserted with an updated sn\_shift\_planning\_sched\_attr sysID into the table.

The switch 'Enable/disable association of territory resources with demand channels' can be turned on even when FSM shift scheduling is turned off

</td><td>

 

</td><td>

1.  Provision an instance with FSM Territory Planning, Advanced Capacity, and WFO installed.
2.  Activate a territory model.
3.  Navigate to the 'Field Service Configuration Assignment' tab.

 Expected behavior: Enabling/disabling the association of territory resources with demand channels can't be turned on unless the 'Enable FSM shift scheduling' toggle is enabled.

 Actual behavior: The toggle 'Enable/disable association of territory resources with demand channels' can be set to enabled without setting 'Shift Scheduling' to true.

Work order tasks \(WOT\) are unassigned after flexible breaks are updated by Schedule Optimization \(SO\)

</td><td>

When a flexible break is optimized by the SO engine, it inserts/updates records in the sn\_shift\_planning\_agent\_schedule table to update the original break start and end time. This operation is triggering the business rule 'Re-assignment on shift deletion', which causes all of the tasks in the shift to be unassigned, even if they don't overlap with the break event.

</td><td>

1.  Set up a Workforce Optimization \(WFO\) schedule with flexible breaks.
2.  Set up an optimization batch or intraday configuration for the same group/territory.
3.  Run optimization.

 Observe that the tasks are assigned by SO, but then immediately unassigned after the flexible breaks are updated.

The 'TS Index Stats' job shouldn't check a table that's not indexed

</td><td>

The 'TS Index Stats' job is pulling 45 million records from syslog and caused an out of memory error on the node.

</td><td>

1.  Run the 'TS Index Stats' job.
2.  Turn on the syslog\(collection\) text index attribute in sys\_dictionary.
3.  Create a record in ts\_index\_name for syslog.
4.  In the background, run the new GlideTSIndexStatistician\(\).allStats\(\);.

 Expected behavior: It shouldn't load all records for the table.

 Actual behavior: There's a warning for syslog large table: 'Table handling an extremely large result set'.
