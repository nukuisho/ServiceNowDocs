Reports containing reference-type catalog item variables \(lookup\) fail to render data after upgrading to the Australia release

</td><td>

After upgrading to the Australia release, reports that contain reference-type catalog item variable columns fail to render data correctly. The affected reference-type variables don't resolve their lookup values, and their presence in the report additionally causes all other columns — including native table fields such as **Number**, **Created**, and **Closed** — to render as empty across all rows.

</td><td>

MID Server is unable to fetch credentials after upgrading to Zurich or Australia

</td><td>

In certain versions, there's a Unified Secrets Gateway \(USG\) service for credential management. During the upgrade to those versions, a system trigger script is designed to automatically execute and populate the sys\_​secret\_​identity \_​group\_​member table with the MID Server identity group mappings required for USG authentication. However, this trigger fails to complete successfully, leaving the table incompletely populated. As a result, the MID Server can't authenticate with USG and fails to retrieve credentials.

System Events

 PRB1969068

</td><td>

The 'Events process 0' job yields to memory pressure, causing event processing delays

</td><td>

When node memory pressure is high \(live set ≥ ~91%\), the JobYieldCheck mechanism triggers a yield on events process 0 despite it being a priority 25 \(high priority\) job. High-priority jobs should not be subject to automatic yield throttling, as this directly delays critical event processing and can result in P1 incidents. The memory pressure itself may be transient or difficult to diagnose quickly — heap dumps often show no obvious culprit, and identifying the root cause of elevated memory usage takes time. During that window, events process 0 is repeatedly yielded, stalling event processing pipelines that users depend on for time-sensitive operations. JobYieldCheck WARNING Job=events process 0 yields due to memory pressure logged on affected nodes. Node memory is sustained at 91–93% of max, with live set at ~91.44% \(~1.28GB\). glide.memory.watcher logs no active transaction warnings alongside persistent memory pressure status = true. There's only a single job visible in the queue during the yield window, yet throttling still triggers. However, users expect priority 25 jobs \(events process 0\) should not be yielded under memory pressure conditions. Yield throttling should be restricted to lower-priority workloads.

The latest component asset isn't selected when multiple asset associations exist in sys\_​ux\_​lib\_​ component\_​ m2m\_​asset,​ which impacts AI summary cards on UI Builder workspaces

</td><td>

When the AI summary card component was upgraded, its asset name changed from now-ai-summary-card/index to uxc-generative-ai/index. The upgrade doesn't clean up the old asset association, so the sys\_ux\_lib\_component\_m2m\_asset table ends up with two associations for the same component \(old and new asset\). The component-to-asset selection query in Glide​Ux​Component​ Def​Provider.​ get​Asset​Names ​By​Component​Sys​Ids\(\)​ had no ordering and relied on default DB ordering. When duplicate associations exist, this could return the stale now-ai- summary-card/index asset, which is incompatible with the latest Platform AI Agents and Skills app. As a result the AI summary card fails to load on UI Builder workspaces. Classic UI uses a different rendering path, so it is unaffected.

Activity Stream

 PRB2027954

</td><td>

An activity filter's field's slushbucket initially has every field selected when the glide.​ui.​\{table\}​\_​activity.​fields property doesn't exist

</td><td>

For non-task tables with an empty 'glide.​ui.​&lt;table&gt;​\_​activity.​fields' property, 'Filter​Field​Repo.​get​Table​Property​Filters\(' returned a hardcoded 'DEFAULT\_FIELDS' constant. This default set was designed for task tables and didn't reflect the actual fields on the table, causing incorrect or missing fields in the activity stream.

</td><td>

1.  Verify that the record is a non-task table record.
2.  Verify that the glide.​ui.​\{table\}​\_​activity.​field isn't set.
3.  On an instance, in UI16, create a interaction record.
4.  Select the **Filter Activity** button, all of the fields should be selected.
5.  Select the **Configure fields** to bring up that the slushbucket now aligns with the fields in the 'Filter Activity'.

Indexing with multiple semantic indexing configurations with the same name on different models isn't working

</td><td>

When multiple semantic index configurations are created on the same datasource with the same semantic field name but different embedding models, only the first configuration is loaded into the active semantic index field cache. Subsequent configurations are silently ignored, so ingestion and search only use one embedding model for that field. Only one embedding model is used for indexing and search when multiple semantic index configurations share the same semantic field name. Additional configurations with the same semantic field name are not visible in get​Semantic​Index​Field​Mapping\(\)​.​ No error or warning is logged when the duplicate-name configurations are skipped. Thus, multi-embedding model support for a single semantic field is broken. Configurations are silently lost during cache population. This affects ingestion, search, and any callers that rely on get​Semantic​Index​Field​Mapping\(\)​.​

</td><td>

1.  Create two active ais\_​semantic\_ ​index\_​configuration records on the same datasource with the same semantic\_field\_name but different embedding\_models values.
2.  Add valid component fields via ais\_semantic\_ component\_field for each record and set a valid semantic\_​ snippetization\_​configuration.​
3.  Flush the datasource object cache \(Ais​Configuration​ Cache​Manager.​ flush​Datasource​ Object​Cache\(\)​\)​.​
4.  Call Ais​Configuration.​ get\(\)​.​get​Semantic​ Index​Field​Mapping\('kb\_​knowledge',​'kb\_​knowledge'\)​.​

Refactor the synthesized Genius Result presence filter from Data Broker into the Java layer

</td><td>

Currently, the logic to conditionally execute the synthesized Genius Result — specifically, the filter that checks whether a Genius Result is present before execution — lives in the Data Broker transform layer \(UX layer\). This means the filter isn't automatically applied across all clients and must be manually maintained per-client in the Data Broker. This logic must be moved into the Java layer so that it is applied universally and automatically for all users, reducing duplication and the risk of inconsistent behavior across different consumers of the Search API.

</td><td>

1.  Review the Data Broker transform at sys\_ux\_data\_ broker\_transform\_ 0c735fb4530422104 accddeeff7b12dd.xml\#L44.
2.  Observe that the conditional filter that gates execution of the synthesized Genius Result on its presence.
3.  Note that this filter only applies to clients using this specific Data Broker transform; it isn't enforced at the Java/API layer.

 A user that bypasses or doesn't use this Data Broker transform doesn't have the filter applied, resulting in potentially inconsistent or unintended behavior around synthesized Genius Result execution.

Bubble chart bubbles render horizontally in Platform Analytics Workspace \(PAW\) instead of distributed across both X and Y axes

After upgrading to Australia, bubble charts in PAW now render bubbles horizontally \(all on Y = -1\) instead of being distributed diagonally across both X and Y axes as expected. The same configuration in the Classic Reporting module \(sys\_report.LIST\) correctly displays bubbles distributed across both axes. The bubbles are rendering and not stacking, but the axis distribution logic differs between PAW and Classic Reporting. In Classic Reporting, bubbles are positioned diagonally across both X and Y axes. Each rating value \(Dissatisfied, N/A, Satisfied, Very Satisfied\) appears at a distinct \(X, Y\) coordinate pair. In PAW, all bubbles are rendered on the same horizontal line \(Y = -1\), with X-axis variation only. There's no Y-axis differentiation.

A relationship editor \(child\) entry incorrectly displays a '\*' suggested marker when only the parent direction is configured in cmdb\_rel\_type\_suggest

After upgrading from Yokohama to Australia, the CI relationship editor's 'Suggested relationship types' list displays both the parent and child directions of a configured suggested relationship with the '\*' suggested marker, even when only one direction was configured in the cmdb\_rel\_type\_suggest table. For example, a cmdb\_rel\_type\_suggest record is created with base\_class = Windows Server, dependent\_class = Business Service, and direction Connects to \(parent\). When the relationship editor is opened for a Windows Server CI, the list shows two entries instead of one: \* Connects to::Connected by \(Parent\) and \* Connects to::Connected by \(Child\). Both entries appear with the leading \*, suggesting both directions are configured. Only the \(parent\) direction was actually configured. Users selecting from the suggested list can't distinguish which direction was the configured one. Because the list is sorted alphabetically and the \(Child\) entry sorts before \(Parent\), the misleading default selection can result in CI relationships being created in the inverse direction of the customer's intent — silently introducing incorrect CMDB data. The \* suggested marker should only appear on the direction that is actually configured in cmdb\_rel\_type\_suggest.

A scoped app is unable to update the http\_connection record

Scoped applications need to update http\_connection records that they themselves created and own. Because the table-level ACL blocks all cross-scope writes, there's currently no supported path for a scoped app to modify its own connection records. The http\_connection table is a platform \(global\) table whose cross-scope access policy grants only read access to all application scopes. In the earlier ServiceNow-managed scoped app flow, Claroty CTD via Service Graph Connector relied on the existing platform-owned Connection and Credential creation path to create http\_connection and related credential records. The available scriptable sn\_cc.ConnectionBuilder APIs cover create scenarios such as createConnectionAlias and createConnectionAndCredential, so the absence of a scoped update path didn't surface when the use case was limited to creation.

During template application in Workspace, the platform passes corrupted or incomplete serialized data to 'GlideRecordEncoder.decode\(\)'. As a result, the current GlideRecord is returned without field values.

Users should be warned/blocked from setting up a reference field that is ineligible

</td><td>

As of Australia, it currently enforces the reference key assignment only in the WDF Hub mapping page and not on sys\_dictionary or sys\_db\_object. When creating/editing the remote table through the hub, there's a method called 'com.glide.datafabric. schemamapping. Remote​Table​Def\#validate​Reference'.​ This method verifies that the reference table and the reference key are valid. If the reference table table doesn't exist/cannot be accessed, or if the reference key's data type is not in the list of allowed types, it blocks the table from being created/updated and throws an error message to the user in the UI. Following this approach, it can add the null value check in this method and throw the appropriate error message to the user.

Remove the step in mixed grouping that allows alerts to join existing groups before the grouping definitions are run in order

</td><td>

The mixed grouping engine handles alerts in two steps. First, it checks whether an alert can join a group that already exists—without following the order the definitions are set up in. After, it goes through all the definitions in their proper order, where it's also allowed to create new groups. The first step disregards the configured definitions order; as a result, an alert can end up in a group created by a lower-priority rule instead of a higher-priority definition. The definition order exists specifically to control which definition gets to group an alert first, so skipping it defeats the purpose of the order. In conclusion, the two-step process should be removed. The mixed grouping engine should go through the definitions once, in order. For each definition, it should allow alerts to either join an existing group or create a new one.

</td><td>

Flow engine is ~200x slower than the equivalent script on 1000 elements, as eager Val.displayValue dominates input wrapping for large collections

</td><td>

A flow that takes a large ComplexObjectCollection as input executes ~200x slower than the equivalent Rhino background script doing the same work. For a 1000-element ForEach input, per-invocation wall-clock is ~143 ms \(vs ~0.7 ms for the equivalent script\). The slowdown scales with the input collection size; small inputs are affected less, but flows that pass large lists as input are heavily impacted even on the user-default execution path \(reporting off, trace off\). There's no functional break as the flow produces correct output, but the per-invocation cost is dominated by work that the engine never reads on the default path.

MIF Hermes doesn't refresh the cluster configuration when the local hermes\_cluster\_config has no primary or after a datacenter-rule change, causing stale/failed cluster resolution for remote owners

</td><td>

When instance A sends a MIF async message to instance B, it needs B's Hermes cluster details \(datacenter + Kafka bootstrap servers\). A keeps a saved copy in the hermes\_cluster\_config table and reads it in Hermes​Producer​Client.​get​Cluster​Info​Set.​ Today that method only calls B's live endpoint \(/api/now/hermes \_cluster\_info, tier-2\) when A has no saved rows for B. Two gaps result: 1. Saved rows but no primary — if A has rows for B where no one is is\_primary\_for\_service=true \(scenario like only a single non-primary cluster row\), the method does not refresh. And method ensure​Topic​Location​For​Instance\(String owningInstance\) then finds primaryCluster == null and the send fails with 'No primary cluster found'. 2. Stale rows after a datacenter change — if a MIMIR rule change moves B's cluster to a new DC, A's saved rows are outdated but still look complete \(they have a primary\), so tier-1 returns them and A never re-discovers → messages Navigate to the old cluster.

</td><td>

1.  Verify that Instance A has a saved Hermes cluster rows for instance B \(service MIF-Hermes\) pointing to B's old datacenter, or a single row that isn't marked primary.
2.  Send a MIF async message from A to B.

 Expected behavior: A resolves B's current cluster details and sends to the correct datacenter.

 Actual behavior: A uses the old/incomplete saved config and sends to the wrong datacenter, or fails with 'No primary cluster found'.

Log reasoning tokens for 3P providers and Now LLM

A new field, reasoning\_token\_count, naming is aligned to existing token fields. The field is added to the GenAI log table. The field is populated for reasoning-capable models across all supported providers. For non-reasoning models, or when a provider returns no reasoning count, the field defaults to zero \(documented\) rather than null-ambiguous. A single, documented convention is applied to stored token values: store the provider's raw output\_tokens and reasoning\_tokens separately such that reasoning\_tokens ≤ output\_tokens, allowing it to derive answer-only tokens as output − reasoning. Existing consumers of the log are unaffected, and total-token reconciliation still holds.

scoreType is forced to 'latest' for non-aggregate indicators due to an undefined aggregateIndicator check

</td><td>

When a visualization widget uses a classic indicator \(sourceType: 'indicator'\) with applyDateRange enabled, the scoreType property is incorrectly forced to 'latest' even when the metric is not an aggregate indicator. This happens because the aggregateIndicator check in the scripted policy evaluates 'undefined !== ''' as 'true', even though the metric object doesn't have an 'aggregateIndicator' property at all. The user loses the ability to select other score types \(sum, average, etc.\) for non-aggregate indicators, and any previously configured scoreType value \(for example, 'sum'\) is overwritten to 'latest'.

1.  Add a single-score \(or any visualization that uses the shared date-range policy\) widget to a dashboard.

An approval summary displays the incorrect attachment

In Service Operations Workspace \(SOW\), attachment records displayed on approval records are inconsistent with the actual request item. When multiple request items contain attachments with the same file name, SOW resolves and displays the attachment from a different record \(incorrect sys\_id\). The attachment file name appears correct, but the underlying file content belongs to a different request item. This behavior isn't reproducible in Classic UI, where attachments are always correctly associated with the respective record. The issue doesn't occur when the attachment file names are unique.

Security Data Filters

A security data filter \(SDF\) is applied redundantly via dotwalk paths, causing missing records in 'OR' queries

</td><td>

This has two distinct symptoms caused by the same underlying duplication. One, when querying a parent table with 'OR' conditions dotwalking into multiple child tables simultaneously, the parent SDF was applied three times — once directly and once per dotwalk CE path — producing conflicting conditions that returned zero records instead of the expected results. Two, when querying a table with a field-based SDF, records where that field was empty/null were incorrectly excluded. This was caused by the same SDF being applied redundantly via a dotwalk CE, which caused the combined filter condition to exclude null matches.

In SLACalculatorNG, an unbounded schedule/DurationCalculator cache causes memory growth during bulk SLA recalculation

</td><td>

During bulk SLA recalculation, SLACalculatorNG accumulates one GlideSchedule and one DurationCalculator instance per unique schedule+timezone combination into unbounded object maps \(this.schedules and this.durationCalculators\). These maps are never evicted and grow proportionally to the number of distinct schedule/timezone pairs encountered across all task\_sla records in the query. In instances with many SLA definitions backed by different schedules, this results in unbounded heap growth for the lifetime of the bulk calculation, degrading instance performance and potentially causing out-of-memory conditions under load.

 Expected behavior: Non-topic skills appear in the picker regardless of whether the applicable topic skills all carry visible design categories. For example, they could appear under 'Others'.

 Actual behavior: Non-topic skills are omitted whenever there is more than one applicable topic skill and all applicable topic skills have a visible design category.

'Get details of problem agent' returns additional duplicate closure messages along with the expected closing message

</td><td>

When the user enters a closing utterance, the agent returns multiple closure messages, and the last two messages are duplicated.

</td><td>

1.  Open Now Assist Portal.
2.  Enter an utterance like 'Help me get details of a problem'.

Observe that the agent returns a response like 'Could you please provide the problem number you'd like details for?'.

3.  Enter an utterance like 'See you later'.

 Expected behavior: The agent returns a response like 'Understood. Feel free to return anytime if you need help.'

 Actual behavior: Additional closure messages show up, and the last two messages are duplicated. For example, the agent might return the following: 'Understood. Feel free to return anytime if you need help. Thanks for chatting! I will go ahead and close this conversation now. I'm here if you need anything else. It looks like you're finished with this chat, so I will go ahead and close it. It looks like you're finished with this chat, so I will go ahead and close it.'.

The Otto session isn't aware of the logged-in user for 'assets managed by me' queries

</td><td>

The Otto/AICT chat session isn't aware of the logged-in user by default. When a user asks a question like 'Can you give me the assets managed by me?', the assistant returns the complete/unfiltered list of assets instead of applying a managed\_by = current user filter. The filter is only applied when the user explicitly names themselves in the query. The assistant should recognize 'me'/'my' references and automatically apply the logged-in session user's context without requiring explicit clarification.

</td><td>

1.  Log in as an AICT user.
2.  Ask Otto: 'Can you give me the assets managed by me?'.

Observe that the full/unfiltered asset list is returned instead of being filtered to the current user.

3.  Ask explicitly by name, for example: 'assets managed by &lt;username&gt;'.

 Observe that the managed\_by = current user filter is correctly applied.

2.  For the same deployment, create another active persona-detail record with persona\_detail\_type = Tone and prompt\_value = Friendly.
3.  Trigger the assistant-config handshake for that deployment via next wave.
4.  Inspect policyConfigs in the response.

 Expected behavior: One policy config entry is returned, containing the sys\_id, name, description, active, and instruction from the policy persona-detail record. Non-policy persona-detail records are excluded.

There's a UI bug when opening the Now Assist panel

</td><td>

When a user has a menu pinned \(whether it's the All menu, Favorites, History, etc.\) and they open the Now Assist panel, the pinned menu turns into a blank white pane. The menu that was pinned also then reappear in the list of other unpinned menus, although the name of the pinned menu still also appears next to the ServiceNow logo with a blank pane beneath it. The blank menu can generally be recovered by opening it from the list of unpinned menus \(where it has reappeared\) and re-pinning it , refreshing the page, or resizing the window. However, there is some inconsistency in whether refreshing or resizing the window always fixes it. If users refresh with the blank menu pinned and the Now Assist panel still open, the Now Assist panel then becomes blank and can only be dismissed/recovered by pinning something else, like sidebar discussions, to the right of the screen to get rid of it. This behavior happens most consistently when a user with a pinned menu logs in and opens the Now Assist panel for the first time after their start screen loads. However, it does also happen MID-session sporadically if users unpin/re-pin different menus and open/close the Now Assist panel frequently.

The 'Location update when PSO is populated' business rule isn't needed anymore

</td><td>

The business rule sets and syncs the **Location** field on the work order from the provider organization, and the same location is applied to the work order task. This seems confusing, since the provider org and location don't necessarily have to be the same. The provider org refers to who is responsible for the work, while the location refers to where the work happens.
