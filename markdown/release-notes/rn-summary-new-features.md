AI Desktop Actions

</td><td>

-   **[Unified automation workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/explore-agentic-desktop.md)**

Use the unified automation creation journey that eliminates manual intervention and saves time.

    -   Request automations from Task Mining to automate desktop activities collected by the Task Mining agent.
    -   Generate automations in Automation Center to create on-screen and background desktop actions.
    -   From Automation Center, automatically create an AI agent that uses these desktop action tools.
    -   Test and deploy the AI agent in AI Agent Studio.

-   **[Record desktop actions with AI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/record-with-ai-ad.md)**

    -   Record on-screen task desktop actions using AI to automatically validate anchor positions and generate screen contexts at design time, reducing automation failures caused by fragile anchors at testing or runtime.
    -   Use a new role, sn\_desktop\_core.desktop\_action\_user that enables users to record desktop action with AI.
    -   Enable AI to analyze the recording in three stages: analyzing the recording, inserting anchors, and generating screen contexts by selecting **Record with AI \(recommended\)** in the **Create desktop action** dialog and finish recording.
    -   Identify AI-generated anchors and screen contexts that are marked with an AI badge in the properties panel. Each screen includes an editable screen context that helps AI agents understand the screen's intent at runtime.
    -   Regenerate screen context and anchor positions that don't meet your expectations by selecting **Retry** in the screen properties panel.
    -   Resolve anchor issues before activation by responding to the alert that appears when any screens have failed anchors in a desktop action recorded with AI.
    -   Reduce manual setup time by letting AI auto-fill the desktop action intent in the **Action description** field when you select the **Record with AI** option. An AI badge confirms that the description was filled by AI.
    -   Control whether **Record with AI** is the default recording option by configuring the new **sn\_desktop\_core.record\_with\_ai** property. By default, its value is set to true.
**Important:** Record with AI requires the ServiceNow AI Lens skill to be active and you must have the sn\_desktop\_core.desktop\_action\_user role. If any of these conditions is not met, the **Record with AI** option is unavailable. You can still create desktop actions using auto-capture mode. Contact your ServiceNow administrator to enable these settings.

-   **[Configure parameters for dynamic values](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/configure-parameter-record-ad.md)**

    -   Provide dynamic values, such as credentials and user-specific inputs to on-screen task desktop actions by creating Desktop action parameter records in your ServiceNow instance.
    -   Make a single stored parameter value available to all users by selecting the **Shared** field on a parameter record. When **Shared** is selected, the agent uses the one associated parameter value record, regardless of which user triggered the agent. Only a user with the sn\_aia.admin role can create the parameter value record for a shared parameter.
    -   Encrypt all associated parameter value records by selecting the **Mark As Sensitive** field on a parameter record. The agent decrypts the value at execution time. For non-sensitive parameters, the value is passed to the agent as plain text.
    -   In the AI Desktop Actions client application, enable the Set Text and Send Keys step types to use parameters by selecting the **Use parameter** property.
    -   In AI Agent Studio, when you add an on-screen task desktop action tool that contains inputs configured for parameters, the **Map parameters** section appears. You can map inputs of on-screen task desktop actions to parameter records. These parameter values aren't exposed in agent instructions. Select a parameter record for each input to define the value the AI agent uses when executing the desktop action.
**Important:**

The **Shared** and **Mark As Sensitive** fields can only be modified when no Desktop action parameter value records exist under the parameter record.


-   **[Use the new application name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/agentic-desktop-landing-page.md)**

The product formerly referred to as Agentic Desktop has been rebranded as AI Desktop Actions. All UI labels, navigation elements, and in-product text updated to reflect the new name.

-   **[Automate dynamic steps with desktop actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/web-agents-overview.md)**
    -   Use the desktop action to automate dynamic steps that are determined by AI during execution.
    -   Install the **ServiceNow Web Automation** chrome extension for AI agent to interact with web applications.
    -   Use the default Web Automation Agent AI agent and Web Automation agentic workflow to automate repetitive tasks.
    -   See every click, keystroke, and scroll your AI agent makes in real time, with consent prompts before execution kicks off and timely warnings before your session expires.
    -   Pause a running AI agent, provide corrective input, and resume. The AI agent replans based on your instructions, keeping execution on the right track.
-   **[Use the onboarding wizard to get the app overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/desktop-actions.md)**

Get a quick overview of the application by using the onboarding wizard that highlights recording, refining, testing, and activating desktop actions.

Select **Skip intro** to bypass the onboarding wizard and go to the home page. Select the **Don't show this again** option to prevent the wizard from appearing the next time you open the app. After completing the onboarding wizard, select **Get started** to start creating desktop actions.

-   **[Filter required inputs for testing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/test-activate-desktop-action-ad.md)**

Use filtering options to filter the inputs that are required.

    -   **Show Inputs** — Filters the screens with required input fields.
    -   **Show All** — Removes the filter and displays all screens.

-   **[Improved error and informational messages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/test-activate-desktop-action-ad.md)**

Improved error and informational messages for better guidance and troubleshooting during testing of desktop actions.

-   **[Delete button on image canvas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/agentic-desktop-overview.md)**

Added a **Delete** button to the image canvas to remove a screen.

-   **[Test button for a screen in the Design tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/agentic-desktop-overview.md)**

Test screens directly from the design tab while designing desktop actions.

AI Risk and Compliance

</td><td>

-   ****

Use Now Assist for AI Risk and Compliance to get AI-powered assistance throughout the AI asset lifecycle. After upgrading to version 22.4.x, users with the AI Risk and Compliance AI user \[sn\_airc\_gen\_ai.airc\_ai\_user\] and AI Risk and Compliance AI agent user \[sn\_airc\_gen\_ai.airc\_ai\_agent\] roles can access the following capabilities:

    -   Create and document governance, risk, and compliance issues with guided assistance from the employee center.
    -   Generate concise summaries of complex GRC issues for faster review and decision-making.
    -   Create executive summaries of risk assessments to communicate findings to stakeholders.
    -   Generate responses to assessment questions based on past assessments and reference documentation.
    -   Identify related control objectives from your controls library to reduce duplication.
Use these capabilities to capture AI risk context early in the development process and address compliance requirements throughout the system lifecycle.

-   **Risk‑based classification during intake**

After upgrading to version 22.0.3, if you have the AI risk and compliance business user \[sn\_grc\_ai\_gov.ai\_risk\_and\_compliance\_business\_user\] role, you can now classify AI systems using a risk‑based approach at intake, enabling organizations to capture AI risk context early and align governance workflows with regulatory and internal risk requirements. This improvement to the AI use case request form supports more accurate AI oversight throughout the system life cycle.

-   ****

After upgrading to version 22.0.3, if you have the AI Case Management \(sn\_ai\_case\_mgmt\) application installed and the AI case business user \[sn\_ai\_case\_mgmt.ai\_case\_business\_user\] role, you can navigate to the Employee Center to access the Anonymous Reporting Center and submit AI cases anonymously, enabling broader participation in AI governance while protecting the identity of reporters. No additional role is required to submit an anonymous report directly through the Anonymous Reporting Center. Broader participation helps organizations identify potential AI risks earlier by removing barriers to case submission.

-   **Offboard AI models and datasets**

After upgrading to version 22.0.3, if you have the AI risk and compliance analyst \[sn\_grc\_ai\_gov.ai\_risk\_and\_compliance\_analyst\] or AI risk and compliance manager \[sn\_grc\_ai\_gov.ai\_risk\_and\_compliance\_manager\] role you can manage AI asset offboarding life cycle tasks. Managing these tasks supports completion of governance-related activities, such as risk and impact assessments, conformity reviews, issue closure, and audit documentation, when an AI asset is retired or removed from active use.

Advanced Risk

</td><td>

-   **Worst case aggregation rollup for risk scoring**

After upgrading to version 22.3.2, use the worst case aggregation rollup method that derives all scores from a single risk record based on the highest residual risk. You can configure this option on the Risk Assessment Methodology \(RAM\) form. By using a single risk record as the source, this method keeps all rolled-up scores aligned to a real risk scenario, supporting traceability, audit requirements, and enterprise governance.

-   **Hide Not applicable option in control and residual assessments**

After upgrading to version 22.3.2, configure the Risk Assessment Methodology \(RAM\) to hide the Not applicable check box in control effectiveness and residual assessment sections by using the **Hide assessment not applicable** option. This change reduces calculation errors and improves the reliability of assessment results.

-   **Parallel review and feedback for Risk assessment project**

Parallel review and feedback is now enabled by default on the risk assessment project record page and the project assessment page, in both stacked view and grid view. You can use collaborative review workflows without manual configuration, which removes the setup overhead previously required by the custom page structure of risk assessment projects.

-   **Redirect GRC notification links to the appropriate workspace**

After upgrading to version 22.3.2, redirect to the appropriate workspace when accessing GRC records from email notifications, based on the access and role. This feature improves usability, reduces confusion, and supports adoption of workspace-based workflows.

-   **Template versioning for Risk Identification**

After upgrading to version 22.3.2, Risk Identification supports smart assessment template versioning. New versions can be created from existing templates without creating a new template, and assessments use the latest published version.

-   **Audit entry field on Risk Assessment Project**

**Note:** This option is available if Audit Management and Audit Workspace are installed. Assign the sn\_audit\_ws.third\_line\_manager role to a user to use this feature.

-   **Risk event response template enhancements**

After upgrading to version 22.0.x, users with the Risk Manager \[sn\_risk.manager\] or Risk Admin \[sn\_risk.admin\] role can configure risk event response templates using dynamic, entity‑driven assignments. These changes enable assignments to be derived from entity data alongside existing static user or group selection.

You can select user fields defined on the entity \(such as Owner or Sub-owner\) or entity stakeholder personas when configuring:

    -   Risk event owner assignment
    -   Issue creation and assignment
    -   Risk event approvers
-   **Risk Suggestion AI Agent enhancements**

After upgrading the Now Assist for Integrated Risk Management \(IRM\) application to version 22.x, the Risk Suggestion AI Agent supports a more context‑aware and conversational workflow. After selecting risk types, you can provide additional context to refine search results, with the agent dynamically asking follow‑up questions when needed. Before adding risks to the suggested risk section, you can review and modify suggested risks by updating descriptions, renaming risks, or removing items from the list.

-   **Control Objective workflow**

After upgrading to version 22.0.x, you can use a defined workflow to update control objectives. Changes can be drafted and reviewed without changing the current active version, which helps avoid unintended changes to related controls, and risk records. Only approved updates become active. The workflow also sets clear responsibility for making updates and helps keep control objective information consistent and up to date.

Application Vulnerability Response

</td><td>

-   **[Enhancements to the Invicti Vulnerability Integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/invicti-vuln-integration.md)**

Added the Invicti Platform Integration. Support for the Invicti Platform APIs introduces three new integration jobs that connect directly to the Invicti Platform cloud service:

    -   Application Integration — Imports the list of applications being scanned in Invicti Platform into your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance as discovered applications.
    -   Scan Integration — Pulls scan records from Invicti Platform, providing scan metadata to correlate with vulnerability findings.
    -   Vulnerability Integration — Imports application vulnerability findings from Invicti Platform and creates or updates application vulnerable items in Vulnerability Response in your ServiceNow AI Platform®.
Enhancements to Application life-cycle management: When an application is deleted or decommissioned in Invicti Platform, your ServiceNow AI Platform® automatically deactivates the corresponding discovered application and closes all associated application vulnerable items \(AVITs\), keeping your vulnerability inventory accurate without manual cleanup.

-   **[Configuring lookup rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/sem-configure-lookup-rules.md)**

The Applies to field is added to the Rules page for Configuration \(CI\) lookup rule records. For third-party and ServiceNow® integrations that support both Application Vulnerability Response \(AVR\) and Vulnerability Response \(VR\) lookup rules, like the Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz, for example, select one for a rule:

    -   **Discovered Application** for Application Vulnerability Response lookup rules.
    -   **Discovered Item** for Vulnerability Response lookup rules.
**Note:** The field is left empty by default. If you leave this field empty for lookup rules that support both VR and AVR integrations, background jobs for both applications apply changes on the same set of lookup rules. This state might cause a conflict and set the reapply flag incorrectly. With this distinction set, after the respective background jobs for AVR and VR are completed, the system resets the flag only for the lookup rules for the background job that was run.

-   **[Activate the Wiz Asset Integration and identify resource types for import](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/wiz-assets-resources-tab.md)**

Enhancements to the Wiz integration include:

    -   Starting with version 32.1 \(USEM\) and version 4.1 \(non-USEM\), the Asset integration is deactivated by default and is not a mandatory prerequisite for the other Wiz integration imports.

If you choose to activate it, the Asset integration will retrieve assets for all resource types if you don't specify the ones you want on the **Asset Integration Configuration** tab. To avoid importing vulnerability data you don't need, identify only the resources \(assets\) that you want to import with this integration.

    -   Resource Type is no longer a mandatory field for configuring the Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz. You can now save Wiz configurations for the integrations without specifying a Resource Type, simplifying setup for use cases where specifying a Resource Type isn't appropriate.
-   **[Wiz Application Vulnerability Response Integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/wiz-exploring-avr-sca-secrets.md)**

Import application, Software Composition Analysis \(SCA\), findings, Secrets \(passwords, tokens and keys\) data with the following Wiz Vulnerability integrations:

    -   Application List Integration
    -   SCA Findings Integration
    -   Secret Findings Integration
You can configure these integrations on the Wiz Vulnerability Integration configuration page along with the other Wiz Vulnerability integrations. View imported application list data such as Product Model and Source application ID from Wiz on the Discovered Applications \[sn\_vul\_app\_release\] table records, and SCA and Secrets data on the Application Vulnerable Items \[sn\_vul\_app\_vulnerable\_item\] table records.

-   **[GitHub Application Vulnerability Integration – Generic secrets support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/configure-github-vulnerability.md)**

The GitHub Secret Scanning Integration supports imports of generic secrets in addition to standard secrets from your GitHub repositories. An enhanced Manage generic secrets in ServiceNow configuration option lets you control whether generic secrets are ingested. Imported secrets are mapped to Application Vulnerable Items \(AVITs\) with the scan type, Secret, while generic secrets are mapped with the scan type, Generic Secret.

-   **[Improved vulnerability assessment workflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/vr-ws-vuln-assessment.md)**
    -   CI filtering for vulnerability assessments: You can now filter which configuration items are included in a vulnerability assessment using a condition builder.
    -   Business Application population on AVITs: AVITs created from SBOM assessment results now include Business Application information, helping you understand application impact and prioritize remediation.
    -   Priority roll‑down from vulnerability assessments: Updates to the priority of a vulnerability assessment now automatically roll down to associated VITs and AVITs, ensuring consistent prioritization based on the highest severity.
-   **[Enhanced Compensatory controls](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/requesting-approving-risk-reduction.md)**

When new vulnerable items are ingested and associated with a remediation task that already has an approved compensating control, the reduced risk rating is now automatically inherited by those new vulnerable items.

Compliance Case Management

</td><td>

-   **Smart assessment versioning of assessment templates**

You can create a version of an existing compliance case assessment template to revise the questionnaire and response options, without disrupting assessments that are already in progress. New assessments use the latest published version of the template.

-   **Report a compliance case anonymously from the Anonymous Reporting Center**

Employees can now use the Anonymous Reporting Center to report compliance violations such as fraud and embezzlement, workplace misconduct \(harassment, discrimination\), bribery and corruption, and other concerns without revealing their identity or location.

Accessed through the Employee Center, the Anonymous Reporting Center portal automatically logs users out to enforce anonymity, creates case records without mapping to employee identity, and provides a unique report key and report number for secure follow-up communication.

CAPTCHA‑based verification is used to authenticate submissions, and the system generates a report statement summarizing the case after submission. Employees can save a copy of their report for future reference. For security and confidentiality, the submitted information is not displayed again. Reports are routed to the appropriate compliance team based on the nature of the concern.

Throughout the investigation process:

    -   Investigators can request additional information through a comments system visible to the reporter
    -   Reporters can follow up on their case using their report key to check progress and respond to questions
    -   All interactions maintain reporter anonymity at every step; no identity or location data is ever captured or linked
This enhancement enables organizations to build trust, mitigate risks before escalation, and ensures regulatory compliance with whistleblower protection requirements.

-   **GRC case summarization skill for compliance cases**

After upgrading Now Assist for Integrated Risk Management \(IRM\) application to version 22.x, Compliance analysts can use the case summarization feature to quickly understand a compliance case without manually reviewing every field, attachment, or related list.Now Assist analyzes key case attributes—such as timelines, impacted areas, evidence, and actions—and generates a structured summary directly inside the compliance case.

This solves a common problem: case data is often lengthy, scattered across multiple related lists, and difficult for analysts to digest efficiently. Analysts can also save and edit summaries as case data evolves, ensuring the record stays current.

By consolidating all relevant information into a single, coherent narrative, Now Assist reduces investigation time, improves consistency across reviewers, and supports faster decision-making.

-   **[Activate the Wiz Asset Integration and identify resource types for import](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/wiz-assets-resources-tab.md)**

Enhancements to the Wiz integration include:

    -   Starting with version 32.1 \(USEM\) and version 4.1 \(non-USEM\), the Asset integration is deactivated by default and is not a mandatory prerequisite for the other Wiz integration imports.

If you choose to activate it, the Asset integration will retrieve assets for all resource types if you don't specify the ones you want on the **Asset Integration Configuration** tab. To avoid importing vulnerability data you don't need, identify only the resources \(assets\) that you want to import with this integration.

    -   Resource Type is no longer a mandatory field for configuring the Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz. You can now save Wiz configurations for the integrations without specifying a Resource Type, simplifying setup for use cases where specifying a Resource Type isn't appropriate.
-   **[Tenable compliance test uniqueness key](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/cc-tenable-compliance-test-uniqueness-key.md)**

You can now configure which identifier the system uses to uniquely match incoming Tenable compliance test records. Previously, compliance tests were identified by the check\_id field, which caused records to be overwritten when multiple tests shared the same control identifier. You can now select the identifier that best matches how your Tenable data is structured \(**compliance\_control\_id**, **check\_id**, or **compliance\_functional\_id**\), ensuring test records are accurately preserved during ingestion.

-   **[Qualys parameter to ignore passed test results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/Qualys-cc-Integration.md)**

Starting with v15.2.5 of Configuration Compliance, the ignore\_passed\_result integration instance parameter for the Qualys Integration for Security Operations has been added.

This parameter is set to `false` by default so that passed test results imported by Qualys are not ignored.

Set the parameter to **true** to ignore passed test results on import.

**Note:** If activated, this parameter does not impact closure of the test results. For example, if you activate the parameter, and a failed test result from a previous import has since passed, it will be closed correctly.

-   **[AWS Integration for Security Exposure Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/aws-integration-for-security-exposure-management-overview.md)**

The Vulnerability Response integration with AWS Inspector imports host and container vulnerability findings from AWS Inspector.
    -   AWS Security Hub is a security service that is used to centralize and update security checks across AWS accounts. It provides a unified view of security alerts and compliance status by integrating with various AWS services. The Vulnerability Response integration with AWS Security Hub imports host, container vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations from AWS Security Hub.
-   **[Optimized Tenable.io Compliance Results ingestion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/tenableIntegration.md)**

Starting with v 6.1.3, the Tenable.io Compliance Results Integration is replaced by the Tenable.io Fixed Compliance Results Integration and Tenable.io Open Compliance Results Integration. Compliance results are now imported based on their status, optimizing ingestion performance and scalability for environments with large volumes of compliance data while keeping remediation and compliance tracking aligned with the current state of findings.

-   **[Qualys Integration – API enhancements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/c_QualysVulnIntegration.md)**

The Qualys Vulnerability Integration has been upgraded to support newer Qualys API versions across Host Detection, Host List, Knowledgebase, PC Controls, PC Policies, and PCRS integrations. The integrations now ingest additional data fields, including vulnerability detection source, authentication privilege status, active status for controls and policies, and cloud metadata, giving you better visibility into your vulnerability and compliance data. Use the new `posture_api_version` integration instance parameter to choose between the default v2.0 APIs or the newer v5.0 streaming APIs for the PCRS Policy Host and PCRS Test Results integrations.

-   **[Unified Microsoft Defender Integration for Security Exposure Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/ms-defender-sem.md)**

The Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Defender Threat and Vulnerability Management \(MS TVM\) plugins are now consolidated into a single plugin: Microsoft Defender Integration for Security Exposure Management. This consolidation deprecates the standalone Microsoft Defender for Cloud plugin. The unified plugin also introduces container image vulnerability ingestion from Microsoft Defender for Cloud, creating Container Vulnerable Items on your instance. A guided migration path is available to transfer existing data from the deprecated applications to the unified plugin.

-   **[Remediation task rule execution mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/sem-grouping-multiple-findings-remediation-tasks-processing.md)**

You can now choose how remediation task rules are evaluated during ingestion.

    -   Use Service Graph Workspace which is included in the CMDB Workspace store app, to view data, such as company, location, user, and CMDB data, using panels and dashboards. The Service Graph Workspace is specifically organized to help CMDB administrators, data owners, and analysts work with the CMDB. You can search the CMDB in Service Graph Workspace without having detailed knowledge of the CMDB data model by using contexts that are mapped to CI classes as navigation.
    -   Configure de-duplication remediation processes for related tables to turn off automated workflows, such as ignoring errors and skipping business rules, that might block referenced duplicate CIs from updating to the main CI. Skipping automated workflows for related tables enables de-duplication tasks, which would otherwise fail, to complete successfully. For more information, see [Effects on related tables \(such as Change\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/de-duplication-tasks.md) and [Turn off workflows of related tables during remediation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/dedup-ci-disable-workflow.md).

-   **Now Assist for Enterprise Architecture \(EA\) enhancements**

Added support for third-party LLM models: GPT-5.4 mini and Gemini 3.5 Flash


[Australia Patch 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/release-notes/australia-patch-3.md)

-   **[Enterprise Modeling and Visualization enhancements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-portfolio-management/eaw-work-with-ent-model-and-visual.md)**
    -   Align and distribute shapes in a modeling diagram:
        -   Align two or more selected shapes using the alignment options on the diagram toolbar \(**Align left**, **Align center horizontally**, **Align right**\) or the **More alignment options** menu \(**Align top**, **Align center vertically**, **Align bottom**\).
        -   Distribute three or more selected shapes at equal horizontal or vertical spacing using the **Distribute horizontally** and **Distribute vertically** options.

For information, see [Align and distribute shapes in a modeling diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-portfolio-management/eaw-align-distribute-shapes.md).

    -   Shape preview popover in the **Shapes** panel: When you hover over a shape icon in the **Shapes** panel, a preview popover appears to the right of the panel showing a larger view of the shape and its label.
    -   Bi-directional connector ports across shape libraries: Connector ports on the following shape libraries are bi-directional. You can use any connector port—top, bottom, left, or right—as either an input or an output when connecting shapes in a diagram:
        -   ArchiMate shapes
        -   AWS shapes, including AWS Group shapes
        -   CSDM shapes
        -   EA Extended shapes
    -   Add specific related records to a shape: When adding related records to a shape in a modeling diagram, expand the upstream or downstream entity types to view their individual records, and select only the specific records you want to add to the diagram. For information, see [Add related records in the modeling diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-portfolio-management/eaw-modeling-add-related-records.md).
    -   Shape connector properties: Configure the connector between two shapes in a modeling diagram by using the connector toolbar. The toolbar shows different controls depending on the notation of the connected shapes:

        -   For ArchiMate connectors \(both shapes are ArchiMate\), use the **Relationship type** drop-down to select an ArchiMate 3.2 relationship. The drop-down now includes **Access** \(with single-direction, bidirectional, and unspecified variants\), **Serving**, **Association**, and **Triggering**. **Influence** is now available in the drop-down \(previously a shape in the ArchiMate shape library\) and displays a +/- adornment on the connector to indicate the direction of influence. The **Assignment** arrow icon is corrected to match the ArchiMate 3.2 specification.
        -   For non-ArchiMate and mixed connectors \(at least one shape is non-ArchiMate\), set the **Line style** \(solid, dashed, or dotted\), **Start arrow** and **End arrow** styles, and **Icon** \(BPMN message flow decorator\).
        -   For any connector, add a text label by using the **T+** control.
For information, see [Shape connector properties in Enterprise Modeling and Visualization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-portfolio-management/eaw-connector-properties.md) and [Set shape connector properties in Enterprise Modeling and Visualization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-portfolio-management/eaw-set-connector-properties.md).

    -   The width of the right side panel on the modeling diagram canvas is saved as a user preference and persists across sessions.
    -   Group shapes stay anchored when child shapes are added: Dropping a child shape into an EA group shape no longer shifts the group's position on the canvas. The group stays at its current position and resizes its bounds to accommodate the new child shape.
    -   Replace an existing shape or entity in a modeling diagram with a different shape type. Existing connections and relationship lines associated with the shape are preserved after the replacement. For information, see [Replace a shape in a diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-portfolio-management/eaw-modeling-replace-shape.md).
    -   Upload an image of an existing process diagram to generate a new, editable business process map \(BPM\) diagram in Enterprise Modeling and Visualization, using the ServiceNow AI Lens Now Assist skill. AI Lens identifies shapes, pools, lanes, gateways, and connections from the image, maps recognized shapes to existing records where matching records exist, and stages new records for shapes with no match.

The generated diagram opens in review state on a split canvas: the upper pane displays the generated diagram and the lower pane displays the source image for reference. Shapes identified with a confidence score below 50% are marked with an orange border on the canvas and listed in the Shapes with low confidence scores drop-down in the canvas banner. For information, see [Create a business process map diagram from an image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-portfolio-management/eaw-create-bpm-diag-from-image.md) and [Review a AI-generated business process map diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-portfolio-management/eaw-review-ai-generated-bpm-diag.md)

The BPMN shape library in the Enterprise Modeling and Visualization is expanded with shapes conforming to the BPMN 2.0 standard:

    -   Event shapes: The library now includes all standard BPMN 2.0 event types organized into start, non-interrupting start, intermediate catching, intermediate throwing, end, and boundary events, with trigger configurations for message, timer, conditional, signal, escalation, compensation, error, cancel, link, and terminate.
    -   Gateway shapes: Expanded to include event-based, instantiating, and complex gateway types. Gateway shapes can be resized on the canvas.
    -   Activity shapes: Expanded to include eight task types \(task, user task, service task, manual task, script task, business rule task, send task, and receive task\) and call activity shapes. Four existing shape names are updated to align with the BPMN 2.0 standard: Default → Task, System → Service task, User → User task, Manual → Manual task.
BPMN shapes in the **Shapes** panel are organized into four sub-categories: **Event**, **Activity**, **Gateway**, and **General**. When you drag a shape from the panel onto the canvas, the shape displays its actual icon while dragging.

ArchiMate Technology layer shape names are updated to match the ArchiMate 3.2 specification: Infrastructure Function → Technology Function, Communication Path → Path, Infrastructure Interface → Technology Interface. The Network Box and Network shapes, which aren't part of the ArchiMate 3.2 standard, are removed.

Policy and Compliance Management

</td><td>

-   **Personal authentication and document access permissions in policy authoring**

After upgrading Policy and Compliance Management to 22.3.2, you can enable personal authentication for policy authoring in Microsoft SharePoint and Google Drive. When enabled, policy authoring uses a hybrid authentication model. Create, connect, and upload operations run under the logged-in user's personal credentials, while document access permission grants and content sync always run under the shared service account. This approach supports audit traceability at the individual user level for document operations and keeps access management and sync consistent regardless of who initiates them.


-   **Dashboard access from Compliance Workspace**

After upgrading to 22.3.2, you can access Policy and Compliance Management dashboards directly from the Compliance Workspace.

The following dashboards are available:

    -   Compliance Overview
    -   Policy Acknowledgement
    -   Policy Exception Overview
    -   Policy Overview
These dashboards are also accessible from the Platform Analytics application.


-   **Assessment template versioning**

After upgrading Policy and Compliance Management to 22.3.2, CRI tiering questionnaire, CRI profile assessment, and control assessment templates support versioning.

When a CRI tiering questionnaire, CRI profile assessment, or control assessment is initiated, the assessment is generated using the latest published version of the template.


-   **Role-based workspace redirection for email notification links**

After upgrading Policy and Compliance Management to 22.3.2, email notification links for Policy and Compliance Management records redirect users to their appropriate workspace based on their assigned roles. Users without a workspace role are redirected to the GRC Task Page, or to the classic UI if the common workspace is not installed. The following record types support workspace redirection: Controls, Evidence, Control risk indicators, Indicator task, Policy acknowledgments, and Policy exceptions.


-   ****

After upgrading Policy and Compliance Management to 22.0.1, the new Control objective workflow feature introduces a structured lifecycle for managing control objective records. Enable this feature using the **Enable Control Objective Workflow** property under **Policy and Compliance** &gt; **All** &gt; **Properties** and is disabled by default.

    -   When disabled, only the State field is added to control objective records. Active records show Published, inactive records show Retired, and new records default to Draft.
    -   When enabled, control objectives move through: Draft, Review, Approved, Current version, and Retired. The following new fields are also introduced: State, Effective date, Revision type, and Record nature.
    -   Editing a published control objective creates a working draft, keeping the published record active until approved changes are published.
    -   Users must select a revision type: Major or Minor. A Major revision moves associated controls back to Draft. A Minor revision applies updates without moving controls back to Draft.
    -   The Owner and Owning Group fields control who can edit the control objective and perform workflow actions.
-   **Rationalizing control objectives**

After upgrading Policy and Compliance Management to 22.0.1, both Unified Compliance Framework \(UCF\) control objectives and non-UCF control objectives can be rationalized together.

    -   Recommendation cards show a Source field to indicate whether it originates from UCF or a non-UCF source.
    -   As UCF control objectives cannot be deactivated, the Identify Duplicates and Finalize sub-states guide the users to retain the UCF control objective. Any UCF recommendations that are not retained are automatically dismissed when the user requests review.
    -   Only one UCF control objective can be retained at a time. If you retain a different UCF control objective, the previously retained one is automatically dismissed.
    -   When rationalization is complete, the retained UCF control objective stays active, accepted non-UCF recommendations are deactivated, and any dismissed UCF control objectives remain active and unchanged.

Privacy Management

</td><td>

-   **External-facing PDR form configuration**
    -   Starting from version 22.3.x of Personal Data Rights \(PDR\), privacy administrators can navigate to **External form configuration** to tailor the public-facing PDR form for their organization. They can map jurisdictions to data subject types and request types, and specify whether an authorized agent can submit a request on behalf of a data subject for each jurisdiction.
    -   For each jurisdiction, administrators can add terms and conditions, disclaimers, and guidance text that requesters see when they submit a request from that jurisdiction.
    -   Administrators can also show or hide form fields based on the combination of jurisdiction, data subject type, and request type that a requester selects. The form collects only the information needed, therefore, requesters see only the fields that apply to their request.
-   **Enable key stakeholders to edit processing activities**
    -   Starting from version 22.3.x of Privacy Management, privacy analysts can add any user, including users without privacy roles, as a key stakeholder on a processing activity. Such users are set to **No privilege to respond to assessments** by default and therefore, can only view the record if they are granted the business user role.
    -   Key stakeholders with the appropriate business user role can access and view the related lists of a processing activity directly from the Employee Center.
    -   After they review the processing activity and find that it needs updating, they can select **Request edit access** to ask for editing rights to a processing activity.
-   **New privacy content in Privacy Management Content**
    -   Starting from version 22.3.x of Privacy Management Content, privacy managers can extend their regulatory library with new ready-to-use authority documents, Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 \(DPDPA\), Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado Privacy Act. When activating an authority document, they can select which citations to add to the library, and then select from the AI-generated control objectives already mapped to those citations.
    -   Privacy Management Content also ships an updated version of privacy risk statement that carries forward the AI-generated risk statements from the previous version and adds new ones. Reinstalling the already existing risk statements after the update may overwrite certain changes made to them.
-   **Smart assessment versioning of privacy assessment templates**

Starting from version 22.3.x of Privacy Management and Privacy Case Management, you can create a version of an existing privacy assessment template to revise the questionnaire, response options, or automations without disrupting assessments that are already in progress. New privacy assessments use the latest published version of the template.

Privacy analysts can now use the Now Assist case summarization feature to quickly understand a privacy case without manually reviewing every field or related list. Now Assist analyzes key case attributes, such as timelines, impacted areas, evidence, and actions, and generates a structured summary directly inside the privacy case. This feature solves a common problem: case data is often lengthy, scattered across multiple related lists, and difficult for analysts to digest efficiently. Analysts can also save and edit summaries as case data evolves, ensuring the record stays current.

-   ****

Employees can now use the Anonymous Reporting Center to report privacy violations such as data breaches or exposure, unauthorized data use, privacy law violations \(GDPR, CCPA\), or other privacy-by-design lapses without revealing their identity or location.

Accessed through the Employee Center, the Anonymous Reporting Center portal automatically logs users out to enforce anonymity, creates case records without mapping to employee identity, and provides a unique report key for secure follow-up communication.

Reports are routed to the appropriate compliance team based on the nature of the concern. Throughout the investigation process:

    -   Investigators can request additional information through a comments system visible to the reporter
    -   Reporters can follow up on their case using their report key to check progress and respond to questions
    -   All interactions maintain reporter anonymity at every step; no identity or location data is ever captured or linked
This enhancement enables organizations to build trust, mitigate risks before escalation, and ensures regulatory compliance with whistleblower protection requirements.

-   **Hierarchy and lineage enhancements**

The Hierarchy and lineage enhancements enables privacy teams to identify which systems, vendors, and applications belong to a specific processing activity by marking relationships as “part of a processing activity.” This ability differentiates scoped components from global or shared connections. Users can toggle between a processing‑activity‑scoped view and a full lineage view, helping them understand data flows in the appropriate context.

-   ****

The privacy regulatory content through Unified Content Management provides pre‑built authority documents, citations, control objectives, and risk statements aligned with major privacy frameworks, including GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, and the NIST Privacy Framework 1.0. These resources are available for download directly from the Privacy Workspace, enabling teams to readily access standardized regulatory content.

-   **[Enhancements to the grants management Workspace- Rolling grant approvals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/government-industry/psds-using-grants-management-playbook.md)**

Propose awards and declines for any scored subset of applications at any time. The Rolling grant approval feature enhances the Grants management funding workflow, by giving Grant Program Managers the flexibility to propose awards and declines for any scored subset of applications at any time, without waiting for the entire proposal portfolio to complete review. From this release, Grant Program Managers can choose to process funding decisions incrementally as proposals are scored, or continue working in the traditional full-portfolio model.

The feature introduces the Funding Allocation Request as a new record type — an approval packet that groups a subset of proposals for Grant Program Director review. The Grant Program Director can either approve the Funding Allocation Request or reject it, returning all proposals in the batch, regardless of whether they were on the funding or decline track. The proposals in the rejected batch feed back into the Grant Program Manager's working queue, re-entering the funding pool for future review and funding allocation opportunities. The Funding Allocation Requests introduce an alternative to the previous all-or-none approval model and enable continuous, long-running grant programs to operate on a single program record.

Release result letters per proposal for Rolling grant approval scenarios in Grants Management. Once a proposal’s funding or decline decision is approved through its Funding Allocation Request \(FAR\), the corresponding award, decline, or ineligibility letter can be issued to that applicant independently—without waiting for program-wide completion.

Smart Assessment Engine

</td><td>

-   ****

Starting with version 22.3.5, responders can use AI Response Assist to draft answers to assessment questions and auto-apply the top suggestion — drawing from multiple sources with citations instead of starting from scratch.

    -   **Previous assessments:** Reuse answers from past SAE and classic assessments, eliminating re-entry across annual refreshes, new regulations, and recurring questionnaires.
    -   **Documents:** Generate answers from documents attached to the assessment or pulled from a document management system \(DMS\). Responders can upload or select PDF, Word, and image \(up to 5 documents, 200 pages each\), preview the document, and trace each answer to a source snippet within the original document.
Responders choose suggestion only mode \(review each suggestion with Apply or Discard\) or Auto-apply mode \(the top suggestion is applied to each question automatically\). Either way, responders can edit any answer before submission.

-   ****

Starting with version 22.3.X, bring assessments directly into the parent workflow. Embedded assessments run inside host record pages, playbooks, and workflow, letting respondents complete their work without leaving the parent context. Configuration is per template category and doesn't require code change. Embedded assessments inherit read access from the parent record—only users with read access to the parent record can read the embedded assessment.

-   ****

Starting with version 22.3.X, update published assessment templates without copying and deprecating the original. When a template manager publishes a new version, the prior version is automatically retired and future assessments use the new version. Template versioning preserves auditability for in-flight assessments while letting template managers publish new versions to reflect corrections, regulatory changes, or annual content refreshes.

    -   A version-info bar on every published template shows the current version and exposes a create new version action that returns the template to Draft.
    -   A full version history view captures who created each version, when, and which prior version it was branched from.
    -   A new Delete template version action is available from the version actions menu.
-   **SAE Enhancements**

These SAE enhancements are available in version 22.3.X and later:

    -   Flag individual questions that need attention with a single click. Flags move through three states—Flagged, Resolved, and Unflagged—and every transition is captured in the assessment activity log.
    -   Add comments at the question level so responders, reviewers, and collaborators can resolve clarifications inline instead of relying on email or external tools. A new Work Notes tab next to the Comments tab provides a separate, role-gated conversation for reviewers or administrators.
    -   Hide conditional questions that don't meet their visibility criteria so responders see only the questions relevant to them, eliminating **Skipped** clutter and reducing assessment fatigue.
    -   Scroll continuously through questions within a section or sub-section instead of paginating, giving responders an uninterrupted answer flow.
    -   Apply multiple filters at once on the question list \(for example, **Unanswered** + **Flagged** + **With comments**\) to focus on exactly the questions that need attention.
    -   View scope item fields directly in the assessment task list so reviewers and assignees can see scope context without opening each assessment.
    -   Programmatically create a combined assessment from multiple assessment IDs using any custom logic, removing the need for manual combine actions. For example, combine all control attestations belonging to an entity group into a single assessment.

-   ****

Starting with version 22.3.X, use granular delegation as a primary owner to assign individual assessment sections to SMEs. Respondents can view the entire assessment for context but can edit only their assigned sections. Monitor overall assessment progress and maintain final review and submission capabilities.

-   ****

Starting with version 22.3.X, edit published templates inline as a template manager, including edits to the titles, descriptions, and reader roles.

Open work items from the EAP Backlog and Hierarchy pages in a new browser tab, so you never lose your context. Right-click any work item, or use the item options menu, to open its full details in a separate tab. This feature lets you review and compare multiple work items side by side without losing your current view.

-   **[Move work items to the top or bottom in EAP Backlog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/schedule-work-items-into-iterations-in-eap-backlog.md)**

Promote an urgent story to the top of a sprint or push deprioritized work to the bottom of a long backlog without dragging items across multiple pages. Right-click any story, feature, capability, or epic in the EAP Backlog, iteration, or team grid and select **Move to top** or **Move to bottom** to re-prioritize the work item in one action. Prioritization changes take effect across all pages, so you can act on shifting priorities even when the work item is far from its target position.

-   **[Live updates in the EAP Hierarchy tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/eap-hierarchy-tab.md)**

Keep working in your hierarchy without breaking your flow each time you create a work item. When you create a work item with the Hierarchy tab open, it is added to your current view immediately, so you don't need to refresh the page to see a new story, feature, capability, or epic. A new top-level item appears alongside the existing top-level items for the selected portfolio configuration. A new child item appears under its parent when that parent is expanded.

-   **[Active work first in the EAP Backlog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/using-eap.md)**

Plan and prioritize without sifting through completed or cancelled work. The Backlog section of the EAP Backlog tab now hides completed and cancelled work items by default, so the list shows only what your teams have to work on. Sprint and Planning Interval \(PI\) sections continue to show all work items, giving you visibility into both ongoing and finished work for each iteration.

Admins can change these settings for either sections using two new system properties: `sn_apw_advanced.show_inactive_items_in_backlog_list` for the Backlog section and `sn_apw_advanced.show_inactive_items_in_iteration` for iteration sections.

-   **[Refresh without losing your place in the EAP Hierarchy tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/eap-hierarchy-tab.md)**

Selecting Refresh in the Hierarchy tab now reloads your data without collapsing the rows you've already expanded or resetting your scroll position. Rows deleted by someone else are removed silently, and new child items appear under their expanded parent. If the grid displays more than 100 non-root items or 100 stories, you're asked to confirm before all rows are collapsed.

-   **[View or delete a dependency directly from the EAP Planning board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/work-item-dependencies-in-eap.md)**

Select a dependency line on the Planning board to open the dependency record in a side panel, without navigating to the work item's full details page. Review the dependent and prerequisite items, or select **Delete** to remove the dependency directly from the panel.

-   **[Backlog and Hierarchy access for CWM connected teams](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/integrate-eap-with-collaborative-work-management.md)**

Teams connected to CWM can now access the Backlog and Hierarchy tabs in EAP. Because sprints are started and completed from the CWM Board, the **Start Sprint** and **Complete Sprint** options are hidden in the EAP Backlog for these teams.

-   **[Admin role enhancements in Feedback](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-business-management/components-installed-with-product-feedback.md)**

UI Builder

</td><td>

-   **Create event-driven UI interactions**

Trigger UI interactions directly from events in UI Builder, allowing you to link event-driven behavior to reusable interaction logic with the following benefits:

    -   Define an interaction once and apply it across multiple events and pages so UI components such as modals don't have to be associated directly with the page anymore.
    -   Connect events to interactions without additional scripting.
    -   Centralize logic for consistent updates and fewer errors.
    -   Previously, Declarative Actions using UXF Client Actions required manual wiring on each page leading to complexity and upgrade risks. UI Interactions replace this with reusable, declarative event mapping.
-   **Update an existing UI interaction flow**

As of UI Builder version 29.2, the UI interaction diagram editor now supports in-place editing, giving you more flexibility when modifying existing interactions without rebuilding downstream flows.

    -   Insert new steps, If/Else logic, or And branches anywhere in an existing diagram.
    -   Swap the outgoing event on a step to change which event continues the flow.
    -   Delete events and their downstream steps directly from the diagram.

Vulnerability Response

</td><td>

-   **[Enhancements to the Invicti Vulnerability Integration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/invicti-vuln-integration.md)**

Added the Invicti Platform Integration. Support for the Invicti Platform APIs introduces three new integration jobs that connect directly to the Invicti Platform cloud service:

    -   Application Integration — Imports the list of applications being scanned in Invicti Platform into your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance as discovered applications.
    -   Scan Integration — Pulls scan records from Invicti Platform, providing scan metadata to correlate with vulnerability findings.
    -   Vulnerability Integration — Imports application vulnerability findings from Invicti Platform and creates or updates application vulnerable items in Vulnerability Response in your ServiceNow AI Platform®.
Enhancements to Application life-cycle management: When an application is deleted or decommissioned in Invicti Platform, your ServiceNow AI Platform® automatically deactivates the corresponding discovered application and closes all associated application vulnerable items \(AVITs\), keeping your vulnerability inventory accurate without manual cleanup.

-   **[Activate the Wiz Asset Integration and identify resource types for import](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/wiz-assets-resources-tab.md)**

Enhancements to the Wiz integration include:

    -   Starting with version 32.1 \(USEM\) and version 4.1 \(non-USEM\), the Asset integration is deactivated by default and is not a mandatory prerequisite for the other Wiz integration imports.

If you choose to activate it, the Asset integration will retrieve assets for all resource types if you don't specify the ones you want on the **Asset Integration Configuration** tab. To avoid importing vulnerability data you don't need, identify only the resources \(assets\) that you want to import with this integration.

    -   Resource Type is no longer a mandatory field for configuring the Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz. You can now save Wiz configurations for the integrations without specifying a Resource Type, simplifying setup for use cases where specifying a Resource Type isn't appropriate.
-   **[Unified Microsoft Defender Integration for Security Exposure Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/ms-defender-sem.md)**

The Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Defender Threat and Vulnerability Management \(MS TVM\) plugins are now consolidated into a single plugin: Microsoft Defender Integration for Security Exposure Management. This consolidation deprecates the standalone Microsoft Defender for Cloud plugin. The unified plugin also introduces container image vulnerability ingestion from Microsoft Defender for Cloud, creating Container Vulnerable Items on your instance. A guided migration path is available to transfer existing data from the deprecated applications to the unified plugin.

-   **[AWS Integration for Security Exposure Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/aws-integration-for-security-exposure-management-overview.md)**

The AWS Integration for Security Exposure Management supports integrations with the following AWS services:

    -   AWS Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continuously scans EC2 instances, ECR container images, and Lambda functions for software vulnerabilities \(CVEs\) and unintended network exposure. The Vulnerability Response integration with AWS Inspector imports host and container vulnerability findings from AWS Inspector.
    -   AWS Security Hub is a security service that is used to centralize and update security checks across AWS accounts. It provides a unified view of security alerts and compliance status by integrating with various AWS services. The Vulnerability Response integration with AWS Security Hub imports host, container vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations from AWS Security Hub.
-   **[Enhancement to Vulnerability Response CI lookup rule configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/create-ci-identifier-rules.md)**

The Applies to field is added to Configuration \(CI\) lookup rule records. For third-party and ServiceNow® integrations that support both Application Vulnerability Response \(AVR\) and Vulnerability Response \(VR\) lookup rules, like the Vulnerability Response Integration with Wiz, for example, select one for a rule:

    -   **Discovered Application** for Application Vulnerability Response lookup rules.
    -   **Discovered Item** for Vulnerability Response lookup rules.
**Note:** The field is left empty by default. If you leave this field empty for lookup rules that support both VR and AVR integrations, background jobs for both applications apply changes on the same set of lookup rules. This state might cause a conflict and set the reapply flag incorrectly. With this distinction set, after the respective background jobs for AVR and VR are completed, the system resets the flag only for the lookup rules for the background job that was run.

-   **[Optimized Tenable.io Compliance Results ingestion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/tenableIntegration.md)**

Starting with v 6.1.3, the Tenable.io Compliance Results Integration is replaced by the Tenable.io Fixed Compliance Results Integration and Tenable.io Open Compliance Results Integration. Compliance results are now imported based on their status, optimizing ingestion performance and scalability for environments with large volumes of compliance data while keeping remediation and compliance tracking aligned with the current state of findings.

-   **[Qualys Integration – API enhancements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/c_QualysVulnIntegration.md)**

The Qualys Vulnerability Integration has been upgraded to support newer Qualys API versions across Host Detection, Host List, Knowledgebase, PC Controls, PC Policies, and PCRS integrations. The integrations now ingest additional data fields, including vulnerability detection source, authentication privilege status, active status for controls and policies, and cloud metadata, giving you better visibility into your vulnerability and compliance data. Use the new `posture_api_version` integration instance parameter to choose between the default v2.0 APIs or the newer v5.0 streaming APIs for the PCRS Policy Host and PCRS Test Results integrations.

-   **[Vulnerability Data Management with Central Vulnerability Database \(CVDB\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/cvd-overview.md)**

The Central Vulnerability Database \(CVDB\) introduces a unified, source-agnostic vulnerability data layer that consolidates data from multiple sources into a single authoritative record, improving accuracy, consistency, and traceability. Key capabilities include:

    -   Unified vulnerability record: Correlates vulnerability data from multiple sources, supports sources including National Vulnerability Database \(NVD\), scanner intelligence, European Union Vulnerability Database, Japanese Vulnerability Database, and vulnerability intelligence feeds.
    -   Priority-based data reconciliation configuration:
        -   Field-level priority: Ensures each attribute \(e.g., CVSS, remediation, exploit status\) can be configured from the most reliable provider.
        -   Source-level priority: Applies a global ranking when field-level rules are not defined.
        -   Hybrid model: Field-level rules take precedence, with source-level fallback; all source data is preserved for full traceability.
    -   Source attribution and traceability: Maintains detailed source metadata, timestamps, and change history to ensure full auditability and transparency.
    -   Data enrichment: Combines CVSS scores, exploit intelligence, and remediation guidance to provide a richer and more actionable vulnerability context.
