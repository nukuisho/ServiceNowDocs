## Choosing a language model service provider

Different models can provide different performance and responses. You can choose which service provider to use for your Now Assist for FSO skills and agentic AI.

You can use Now LLM Service, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all generative AI skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control Tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [Now Assist Admin console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md).

When activating a new or inactive FSO skill, Anthropic Claude on AWS is set as the default model provider.

**Note:** See [Federal exclusion notice](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/now-assist-for-financial-services-operations-fso/now-assist-for-financial-services-operations.md) for more information.

## Configuring ACLs

You can enable security implementation on Now Assist for FSO skills, AI agents, and agentic workflows through access control lists \(ACLs\) and user identities. These ACLs determine which users have permissions to discover and invoke these features.

Configure and manage ACLs for agentic workflows and AI agents in the AI Agent Studio. See [Implement access control in Now Assist AI agents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-security-implementation.md) for more details.

Predefined ACLs exist in Now Assist for FSO for the following:

-   Case summarization skills
-   Disputes intake via Virtual Agent
-   AI agents and agentic workflows in Help Resolve Friendly Fraud
-   Subflows used in Disputes intake via Virtual Agent
-   Subflows and subflow actions used in the Help Resolve Friendly Fraud agentic workflow

See [Configure an ACL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/t_CreateAnACLRule.md) for more information on configuring ACLs.

## Role masking

Required roles: sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent, sn\_bom\_credit\_card.dispute\_agent\_connector.

Agentic workflows and their AI agents use [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with Now Assist applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aw.md).

In the data access settings, you must also add the necessary roles to Resolve friendly fraud using Agentic AI.
