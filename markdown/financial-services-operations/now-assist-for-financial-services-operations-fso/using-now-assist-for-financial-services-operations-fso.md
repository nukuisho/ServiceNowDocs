# Using generative AI in Now Assist for Financial Services Operations \(FSO\)

Use generative AI skills to summarize cases and customer profiles for banking and insurance customerswith Now Assist for FSO. Customers can also use Disputes intake via Virtual Agent to submit card disputes.

## Overview of AI skills in Now Assist for FSO

Now Assist for FSO includes the following skills:

-   **Case summarization**

    Provides an agent with a summary of an insurance claim case or card dispute case, including the issue and the actions taken. An agent can generate a summary of a case to understand the case context. They can refresh the summary so that it includes the latest updates to the case, and post the summary to the case work notes.

    The generated case summary displays in the following areas:

    -   Insurance: Next to the claim details panel in the claim summary page, claim workspace, and claim details page
    -   Banking: Between the activities and case information panel
    The summary includes the information that the agent enters in the case record fields that are listed in the following table.

</table>-   **Customer Profile Summarization**

    Provides a customer service representative \(CSR\) with a concise, comprehensive summary of particular customer. It combines customer data, owned products, and recent history to produce an overview for the CSR to better understand a customer's standing with the bank.

    The summary includes the following information:

    -   Owned active products
    -   Recent transactions
    -   Interaction history
    -   Cases
    The generated customer summary displays in the Customer 360 page as part of Agentic Contact Center for Banking.

    This skill is also used in the Interaction page as a dependency for the customer interaction context summary skill. It assists in generating the summarized context for an interaction.

-   **Customer Interaction Context Summary**

    Provides a CSR with a call-contextual customer summary on the Interaction page. This is generated when a call is assigned to a CSR. The summary focuses on the context of the incoming call, providing the CSR with a snapshot of the customer's situation and sentiment when the call begins.

    The summary includes the following information:

    -   Customer profile, with an overview of the customer and a suggestion on the nature of the call
    -   Related cases
    -   Products and services that the customer has
    The generated context summary displays in the Interaction page as part of Agentic Contact Center for Banking.

-   **Insurance Customer Profile Summarization**

    Provides a customer service representative \(CSR\) with a concise, comprehensive summary of an insurance customer's identity and policy portfolio, eliminating the need to search across multiple data sources. It combines customer identity information and an overview of owned and associated policies to produce a unified and actionable overview for the CSR.

    The summary includes the following information:

    -   Customer tenure with the organization
    -   Active insurance policy types
    -   Current policy state, including upcoming renewals and active endorsements
    The generated customer summary displays in the **Customer summary** section of the Customer 360 page as part of Agentic Contact Center for Insurance.

    This skill is also used as a dependency for the Insurance interaction context summary skill. It must be activated before the Insurance interaction context summary skill can be configured.

-   **Insurance Interaction Context Summary**

    Provides a CSR with real-time interaction summaries and relevant customer context on the Interaction page. This is generated when a call is assigned to a CSR. The summary focuses on the context of the incoming call, providing the CSR with a snapshot of the customer's insurance situation when the call begins.

    The summary includes the following information:

    -   Customer tenure, providing an indication of how long the customer has been with the organization
    -   The customer's likely reason for calling, derived from the live call transcript
    -   Most recent related contact, including date and subject
    -   Last three related cases, including case number, status, date raised, and reason
    -   The insurance product the customer is currently inquiring about, including product name and premium due date
    The generated context summary displays in the **Relevant details for this call** card in the Interaction page as part of Agentic Contact Center for Insurance. The card is not displayed until the customer's identity has been verified, and is not shown when no call context is available and no short description has been provided on the interaction record.

-   **Disputes intake via Virtual Agent**

    Disputes intake via Virtual Agent enhances the customer experience by performing dispute intake with a chat bot. This can streamline the card dispute submission process for customers, and reduce workloads for live agents.

    The following figure shows an example interaction between the Virtual Agent topic, the form data collector application, and Now LLM.

    \[Omitted image "disputes-intake-via-va-overview.png"\] Alt text: Interaction flow in Disputes intake via Virtual Agent between the Virtual Agent topic, form data collector application, and Now LLM.

    -   The Disputes intake via Virtual Agent topic contains the logic of creating a dispute case and filling out the dispute questionnaire based on the conversation. If the answer cannot be determined from the chat responses, it will present a question in a clear and easy-to-understand way to the user. For more information, see [Customize the Virtual Agent topic in Disputes intake via Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/now-assist-for-financial-services-operations-fso/customize-report-a-dispute-va-topic.md).
    -   The form data collector takes the table name and view name as an input, and goes through each question on the form. While iterating over the questions, it asks the large language model \(LLM\) if the question is answered based on the chat history. If it is answered, it moves on to the next question. For more information, see [Form Data Collector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/now-assist-for-financial-services-operations-fso/learn-about-the-form-data-collector.md).
    -   The LLM helps to infer answers from customer responses to proactively fill out fields in the record, and rephrases questions from the dispute questionnaire.
    **Note:** Certain questions will not infer answers from Now LLM to ensure that the correct dispute category and reason code are determined from the conversation. See [Bypassed questions from LLM processing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/financial-services-operations/now-assist-for-financial-services-operations-fso/learn-about-the-form-data-collector.md) for more information.


By default, all skills exist in the global domain. When you use AI in a domain-separated environment, users are only able to access data in their domain. For example, if a user uses the summarization skill, AI only uses material that exists in the user's domain when generating that summary. Additionally, there is no co-mingling of data for domain-separated instances when using generative AI skills. The data resides only on the instance, and the shared services used for generative AI do not persist any requests \(prompts\) and responses. For more information, see [Domain separation in the Now Assist Admin console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/domain-separation-in-the-now-assist-admin-console.md). \(Note that global domain is not the same as global scope. For more information, see [Exploring Next Experience pickers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-pickers.md).\)
