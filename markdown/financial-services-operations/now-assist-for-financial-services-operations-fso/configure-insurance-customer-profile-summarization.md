## About this task

The Insurance Customer Profile Summarization skill uses generative AI to deliver concise and comprehensive customer information in the Customer 360 page, eliminating searching across multiple data sources. It combines customer identity and an overview of owned and associated policies to provide a unified and actionable overview. The skill generates the **Profile** and **Status** sections in the **Customer summary** area of the Customer 360 page.

When the skill is not activated, the **Customer summary** section is not displayed.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Assist Admin** &gt; **Skills** to access the **Now Assist Skills** tab of the Now Assist Admin console.

2.  Select the **Customer** &gt; **FSO** workflow group.

3.  In the **Insurance Customer Profile Summarization** feature card, select **Activate skill**.

4.  In the **Define access** step, define the user access for the skill using Access Control Lists \(ACLs\).

    The roles `sn_ins_csr.claims_agent` and `sn_ins_csr.servicing_agent` are defined by default.

5.  Select **Save and continue**.

6.  In the **Select display** step, enable these options:

    -   In-product desktop
    -   Now Assist context menu
    For each option, select the arrow icon \(&gt;\) to define the roles that can use the skill.

7.  Select **Save and continue**.

8.  In the **Review and activate** step, review your choices and select **Activate** to complete the configuration.


## Result

The skill is activated. The **Customer summary** section is displayed on the Customer 360 page for customers accessed by agents with the `sn_ins_csr.claims_agent` or `sn_ins_csr.servicing_agent` role.
