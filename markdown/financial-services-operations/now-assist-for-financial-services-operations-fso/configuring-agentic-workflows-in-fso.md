# Configure agentic workflows in Financial Services Operations

Activate and modify agentic workflows for Now Assist for FSO in AI Agent Studio.

## Activating agentic workflows

Agentic workflows in FSO are inactive by default. To activate a workflow:

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **AI Agent Studio** &gt; **Create and manage**.
2.  Select the agentic workflow.
3.  In the guided setup, select **Define trigger**.
4.  Select the agentic workflow trigger in the list.
5.  In the Edit trigger form, set **Active** to true.
6.  Select **Save**.

## Modifying agentic workflows

**Important:** By default, all agentic workflows and AI agent records are read only.

To modify an agentic workflow, you must first [duplicate the agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and then proceed with the following steps:

-   Activate the agentic workflow.
-   Activate the agent within the agentic workflow.
-   Activate the trigger to invoke the agentic workflow automatically.

**Important:** When you modify an agentic workflow, AI agent, or tool, make sure that you update all instructions accordingly.
