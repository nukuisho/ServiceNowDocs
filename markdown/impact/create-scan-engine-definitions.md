# Create custom Scan Engine definitions

The Scan Engine contains preexisting base system definitions. However, if your organization has scanning requirements in addition to these definitions, you can create your own.

## Before you begin

**Note:** The Impact Guided package allows up to 10 active custom definitions in a single instance. Definitions above that number will be disabled when a scan is executed. The Impact Total package or the Platform Health add-on with the Guided package may have unlimited active custom definitions in a single instance.

Role required: Scan Engine Admin \(`sn_se.scan_engine_admin`\).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **ALL** &gt; **Impact** &gt; **Platform Health** &gt; **Definitions**.

2.  Select **New**.

3.  Fill in the following fields as needed.

<table id="choicetable_p4w_2cx_2hc"><thead><tr><th align="left" id="d49546e112">

Field/Selection

</th><th align="left" id="d49546e115">

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td id="d49546e121">

**Number**

</td><td>

The unique identifier of the definition. This number is generated automatically.**Note:** Your unique company code will be prefixed to the definition number. You can find your company code by navigating to the `sys_properties` table, then searching for `glide.appcreator.company.code` property.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d49546e138">

**Active**

</td><td>

Select to have the Scan Engine evaluate records to see if there are any findings during a scan.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d49546e150">

**Level of Finding**

</td><td>

Select the severity level of the finding for the definition that displays when real-time monitoring is active: -   **Act**: Prevents users from modifying the record until the definition’s conditions are met.
-   **Recommend**: Prevents users from modifying the record unless they provide an exception reason for why the definition was not followed or until the definition's conditions are met.
-   **Suggest**: Prompts users to check if there is a better solution available.
-   **Review**: Calls out less serious items for review. This does not contribute to technical debt.
See [Understand scan results and findings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/impact/understand-scan-engine-results-findings.md) for additional information.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d49546e190">

**Category**

</td><td>

The category of the definition: -   **Upgradeability**: Assesses the ease of enhancing a ServiceNow instance or application with new features, improvements, security patches, or compatibility adjustments.
-   **Manageability**: Measures the extent to which ServiceNow instances, applications, or infrastructure can be effectively monitored, configured, and maintained.
-   **Performance**: Measures the efficiency of a ServiceNow instance, encompassing aspects such as speed, responsiveness, resource utilization, and overall dependability.
-   **Security**: Measures implementation of protocols across a ServiceNow instance to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, cyber-attacks, and potential vulnerabilities.
-   **User Experience**: Evaluates the quality of user interactions with applications, considering ease of use, efficiency, design, responsiveness, accessibility, and its emotional and functional impact.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d49546e335">

**Specific SN Instances to Run On**

</td><td>

-   Sets which specific ServiceNow instances the definition applies to.
-   For this setting to display, the follow must be true:
    -   **Enable Instance Specific Definitions** must be enabled in the Scan Engine properties.
    -   The My SN Instances table must contain at least one instance.
 **Note:** Only instances defined in the My SN Instances table can be selected here.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d49546e369">

</td><td>

-   The maximum number of findings that can be generated for each definition during a scan.
-   The limit is applied per applicable table. Forr example, if the limit is set to 100, a maximum of 100 findings will be generated for each applicable table.
-   Prevents excessive or redundant findings and optimizes scan performance.


</td></tr><tr><td id="d49546e421">

**Propose Fix**

</td><td>

-   Allows a definition to be defined such that it enables the ability to automatically apply recommended changes to objects in your ServiceNow instance.
-   When selected, the **Proposed Fix Script** field displays.
