# Get started with CMDB success advisor setup for HAM

Set up your Hardware Asset Management \(HAM\) specific advisor dashboard by selecting model categories to define the HAM advisor scope.

## Before you begin

-   Obtain entitlement for HAM Pro. See [Hardware Asset Management licensing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/ham-licensing.md).
-   Opt in HAM resource categories. See [Managing opt-in and opt-out resource categories for HAM in CMDB success advisor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/cmdb-sa-ham-opt-categories.md)

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_admin

## About this task

Selecting model categories defines which hardware asset types CMDB success advisor monitors for HAM data quality. The selected categories determine the scope of the HAM advisor dashboard, including the KPIs, data integrations, and settings that are tracked.

If the HAM advisor dashboard was configure using auto-setup during install or upgrade, you don't need to perform this task. Open the CMDB success advisor landing page to confirm the dashboard setup state. For more information on eligibility conditions and the auto-setup process, see [Automatic dashboard setup for HAM in CMDB success advisor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/cmdb-sa-ham-auto-setup.md)

**Important:** To determine which model categories to select, review the count of operational assets under each category in the Hardware Asset Workspace, or consult with your IT Asset Management \(ITAM\) or HAM administrator for guidance. See [Hardware Asset Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/hardware-asset-management/using-ham-workspace.md).
