# ServiceNow CPQ and Salesforce managed packages

Learn about the ServiceNow CPQ Extension Package and the ServiceNow CPQ Extension for Salesforce CPQ.

ServiceNow CPQ offers two managed packages for Salesforce\(SFDC\) orgs: the ServiceNow CPQ Extension Package and the ServiceNow CPQ Extension for Salesforce CPQ. This article discusses what each package does and how they are different. Details on how to set up or upgrade an environment's managed packages are provided at the end of the article.

## ServiceNow CPQ Extension Package

This is the base package for ServiceNow CPQ interacting with Salesforce. This package allows the user to:

-   Enable any SFDC Product2 record to be a ServiceNow CPQ configurable product through custom fields added to the Product2 record. For detailed steps, see [Configurable products](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/configurable-products-explore.md).
-   Launch the ServiceNow CPQ Admin from in Salesforce by navigating to the Salesforce Products tab, select the list view of 'ServiceNow CPQ View', find a ServiceNow CPQ enabled product, and click the corresponding Click Here link located in the View ServiceNow CPQ Setup column or through the Product2 record itself by clicking the link in the **View ServiceNow CPQ.io Setup** section on the product's page.
-   Support embedding the ServiceNow CPQ UI in Salesforce applications outside of CPQ using Visualforce. See [Use case: Embed ServiceNow CPQ UI in a Salesforce VisualForce page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/use_case_embed_logik_io_ui_in_salesforce_visualforce_page.md).
-   Call ServiceNow CPQ admin APIs using Salesforce Tokens. For detailed steps, see [Admin APIs: Authentication using a Salesforce-connected app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/admin-apis-authentication-via-salesforce-connected-app.md).

Notable components of this package include:

-   Configuration line item object: This object stores the product data that comes out of a configuration including product id or code, price, BOM type, quantity, and extended information. It also includes the unique configuration ID that ties the data back to a specific configuration session and can be referenced in other flows or triggers in SFDC. Finally, it allows users to populate quote line custom fields with information from ServiceNow CPQ. For additional information, review the following video: [Populate quote line Custom Fields.mp4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aojT9Pv0BceH2fLbUtEDmBmesn40YSto/view?usp=sharing)

-   Configuration field data object: This object stores the values set to fields in the configuration and contains the unique configuration ID of that session in order to reference that information upon reconfiguration.

## ServiceNow CPQ Extension for Salesforce CPQ

In order to install the ServiceNow CPQ Extension for Salesforce CPQ. You must have the base package and Salesforce CPQ installed on your org, and at least version 244 or later for your Salesforce CPQ package. This package contains CPQ object specific enhancements over the base package and leverage the ServiceNow CPQ configuration in Salesforce CPQ. This package gives the user the ability to:

-   Launch a ServiceNow CPQ configuration in a CPQ new or amendment quote flow.
-   Populate prior quantity and price in the BOM object for amendment flows.
-   Create child quote lines for the top quote line. Automatically populate the quantity and list price values for each line item based on the information coming from ServiceNow CPQ. This also sets the parent item to be the top line so that the line item appears as a bundle view in the quote.

Notable components of this package include:

-   Custom fields added to top level quote line object:
    -   Configuration UD: The universally unique identifier \(UUID\) of the configuration session. Used upon reconfigure to restore configuration to previously determined state.
    -   Committed Configuration UD: When an amendment quote is created. This field is populated with the Configuration ID. During an amendment, when Reconfigure is finished, the Committed Configuration UD is used to populate Prior Quantity and Prior Price columns on the Configuration Line Item object.
    -   BOM Data: Sales line item data serialized in JSON format. Allows for use of data with the quote line calculator or other actions in Salesforce to perform some calculations or custom logic on top of the BOM data coming from a ServiceNow CPQ configuration.

        For more information on these objects and the user capabilities they add review the following video: [Delta BOM Feature.mp4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Uffs0C7aFWPqkLYRILqZcwgIq2-uxsp/view?usp=sharing)

-   Custom Salesforce REST endpoint that creates a quote and quote lines based on a previously saved configuration, without going through Salesforce CPQ's UI. For more information, review this video: [Request for quote for Omnichannel using APIs.mp4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yaPTCzjU12lNLbznqlQ7CxmQskX_YOQ8/view?usp=sharing)
-   [Flightpath](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/cpq-flightpath.md): allows the administrator to understand how the rules engine responds to end-user inputs by presenting a visual interaction between inputs and triggered rule actions.
-   Configuration Line Item to quote line flow: flow template to populate quote line fields from Configuration Line Item object.

    \[Omitted image "cpq-managed-packages-flow-template.png"\] Alt text: Workflow

    The flow starts inactive and must be enabled.

    Writes Configuration Line Item field to quote line as an example for reference, write the extended info data to the BOM data field. This is where the user would define what fields should be mapped, as well as an optional filter:

    \[Omitted image "cpq-managed-packages-edit-update-records.png"\] Alt text: Edit update records

-   Triggers: Two triggers are included with this package.

    -   Product configurable trigger: This trigger is responsible for setting up configurable products to be configurable. That includes providing the link to ServiceNow CPQ and making the configurable product show up in the ServiceNow CPQ Admin \(on the Configurable Products page\), as well as setting up some product-related data for basic functionality in CPQ quoting.
    -   Amendment quote line trigger: This trigger acts on the custom field Committed Configuration ID. This field gets populated when an amendment quote is created. If the subscription lines originated from a ServiceNow CPQ configuration, this trigger will automatically populate the current Configuration UD to the Committed Configuration UD field. During an amendment, when Reconfigure is finished, the Committed Configuration UD is used to populate Prior Quantity and Prior Price columns on the Configuration Line Item object. The Configuration UD custom field of the amended quote line is updated with new Configuration UD generated during the reconfigure flow. The Configuration UD field on the original subscription is also updated with the new value, so that amendments can be repeated with the latest changes made during the amendment.
    You can disable these triggers through managing the ServiceNow CPQ Admin custom settings referenced above:
