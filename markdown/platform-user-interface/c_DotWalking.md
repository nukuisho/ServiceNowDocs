# Dot-walking to data in related tables

Dot-walking provides access to fields on related tables from a form, list, or script.

If the current table contains a reference to another table, any field on the referenced table can be accessed using dot-walking.

Dot-walking references a field by building a chain of field names separated by dots \(periods\). For instance, **incident.assigned\_to.company** references the company of the user assigned to an incident. The recommended limit for chain length is three levels.
