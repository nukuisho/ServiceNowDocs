# Set up Cloud Deployment Automation

Set up the Cloud Deployment Automation application by configuring the Service Portal page to use the default catalog items.

## Before you begin

-   Request Integration Hub subscription. For more information, see [Legal schedules - IntegrationHub overview](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/legal/snc-addendum-integrationhub.pdf).
-   Activate and configure the [AWS CloudFormation spoke](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/aws-cloudformation.md).
-   Activate the Cloud Deployment Automation app
-   Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Configure the decision tables to perform the required tasks.

    The flows in this application use decision tables to enable admins to configure approvers, assignments, and subflow routing without modifying any of the flows in Workflow Studio. In each decision table by default, you can modify the decision record to select an option \(group, user, or subflow\) that applies to all catalog items in the application. If you want to have different assignments, approvers, or subflows per catalog item, you can add new decisions for each catalog item within the decision tables.

    1.  Navigate to **System Definition** &gt; **Decision Tables**.

    2.  Open the required Cloud Deployment Automation decision table record.

        These steps should be repeated for each decision table.

    3.  Click the **Decisions** tab.

    4.  Click the decision record.

    5.  Select the required group, user, or subflow in **Answer**, depending on what the decision table is used for.

        \[Omitted image "cda-answer.png"\] Alt text: Answer record.

2.  Configure the Service Portal page.

    **Note:** Ensure that you select **Default \[Global\]** and **Global** for current update set and application.

    \[Omitted image "global.png"\] Alt text: Select the global value.
