# Set the order of your workspaces in the Unified Navigation Workspaces menu

Control the display order of workspaces in the Unified Navigation Workspaces menu by setting a numerical order value on each workspace record.

## Before you begin

Before starting, create the system property **glide.ui.next\_experience.workspace\_sorting** and set the value to **Order**. For more information, see [Add a property using the system properties list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_AddAPropertyUsingSysPropsList.md).

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  In the filter navigator field, enter `sys_ux_registry_m2m_category_list.do` and press Enter.

    The UX Application Category M2Ms table appears. This table stores the association between an application and the experience category.

2.  Select the Preview record icon \[Omitted image "next-exp-preview-record.png"\] Alt text: for the workspace that you want to order.

3.  Select **Open Record** to open the UX Application Category M2M form.

4.  In the **Order** field, enter a numerical value.

    **Note:** The lowest ordered workspace appears first in the Workspaces menu.

5.  Select **Update**.
