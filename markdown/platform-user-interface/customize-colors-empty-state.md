# Configure the colors for empty state illustrations

Configure and control the colors automatically applied to empty state illustrations to keep your visual experience engaging while maintaining brand recognition.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

For information on granular roles, see [Granular admin roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/granular-admin-roles.md).

## About this task

As a category, all empty state illustrations share color hook mappings. As a result, the colors that you apply to one empty state illustration type are also applied to the entire empty state illustration category.

**Important:** Configuring empty state illustration colors applies to Workspaces and isn’t supported in the Core UI.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **Theme Builder**.

    The Theme Builder landing page opens in a new tab and is displayed in the Home page view.

2.  Use the Page drop-down list to select the Editor page view.

    \[Omitted image "tb-editor-page-view.png"\] Alt text: Example view of the Editor page.

3.  From the Theme drop-down list, select the theme that you want to edit.

4.  Select the **Image styles** tab from the general styles panel and expand **Empty States**.

    The empty state illustrations available for editing are displayed on the main stage and grouped by type.

    \[Omitted image "tb-image-styles-opened.png"\] Alt text: Image styles tab selected with empty state illustrations listed on main stage and property panel opened.

5.  Select any empty state illustration type from the main stage.

    **Note:** Customizing the colors of any empty state illustration type applies the color change to the entire empty state category, regardless of which type you select.

    The property panel opens automatically.

6.  From the property panel, select the **Colors** tab.

    **Note:** The number of leading or supporting colors differs depending on the illustration category. For example, banner illustrations have one leading color, while empty state illustrations have two leading colors. Leading colors are the main colors in the illustration and supporting colors are accents. They’re listed from most prominent to least.

7.  Select an image color to edit the color using the Color picker.

    \[Omitted image "tb-color-picker.png"\] Alt text: Color picker.

    **Note:** By default, the My Colors tab shows all the available colors for the illustration. You can also use the Custom tab to select a new color.

8.  When you have completed your changes, select **Save changes**.

    **Note:** After you have saved changes to any of the color hooks, a Remove override symbol appears. The Remove override symbol enables you to revert your color changes back to the original auto-generated colors.

    \[Omitted image "tb-color-undo.png"\] Alt text: Remove override symbol.


## Result

The new colors are applied to all empty state illustration types.

If your theme is published, your empty state illustration edits are visible to users who have your theme applied on refresh.
