# Adjust a component to meet accessibility standards

Adjust a component to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.1. When you're editing a component in Theme Builder and see a warning symbol, that indicates that the component doesn't conform with the guidelines for color contrast.

## About this task

When you're editing a component in Theme Builder, you may encounter a warning symbol \(\[Omitted image "tb-accessibility-icon.png"\] Alt text: Accessibility error\), which indicates that the component doesn't comply with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \(WCAG\) 2.1 for color contrast. The WCAG 2.1 contrast ratio that Theme Builder targets for content and UI variables is 3:1. This ratio determines the contrasts between brighter and darker screen colors and how they relate to the user interface. The first digit shows the level of bright colors, and the second digit shows the relative level of dark colors. The 3:1 threshold provides optimal visibility to visually challenged users. For more information, see the [W3C Recommendation site for WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

The total number of accessibility violations are indicated on the red numbered badge \(\[Omitted image "tb-a11y-inspector-badge.png"\] Alt text: Accessibility inspector numbered badge.\) alongside the Accessibility inspector panel.

## Procedure

1.  From the Editor page, access the accessibility violations in one of the two ways listed in the following table.
