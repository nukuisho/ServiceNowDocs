# Upload a custom font to your theme

Upload and preview up to 10 custom font families and an unlimited number of associated font faces in your Theme Builder theme.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

For information on granular roles, see [Granular admin roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/granular-admin-roles.md).

## About this task

A font family is a grouping of fonts that share a common design and may include different font faces, like regular, bold, or italic. For example, Arial is a font family and within the Arial font family you may find font faces such as Arial Regular, Arial Bold, and Arial Italic.

Upload only one font family at a time. Theme Builder does not support variable type fonts.

**Note:** Only upload a font that you're licensed to use. Depending on their size, custom fonts can inadvertently adjust the amount of text on the page. Test and preview your fonts before publishing your theme to your instance.

You can also watch a short video on how to upload a custom font to your theme.
