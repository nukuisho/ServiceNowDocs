# Add or modify Visual Task Board lanes

Any board member can change the names and add new lanes to accommodate the task workflow you want to track. When you create a freeform or flexible task board, it includes the default lanes **To Do**, **Doing**, and **Done**.

## About this task

Unlike guided boards, the lanes on a freeform or flexible task board do not match possible field values.

**Note:** You cannot remove lanes from guided boards.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Self-Service** &gt; **Visual Task Boards**.

2.  Open a task board.

3.  Perform any of the following actions.

**Create a new lane**

</td><td>

1.  Scroll past the last lane and click **Add Lane**.
2.  Enter a title for the lane, then press the Enter key.
 The **Add Lane** option is always available for freeform and flexible boards. It is available for guided boards only if the lanes are based on a reference field, such as **Assigned to**.
