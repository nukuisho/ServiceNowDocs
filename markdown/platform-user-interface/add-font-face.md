# Add a font face

Add a new style such as bold or italic to your custom font family in Theme Builder.

## Before you begin

Role required: ui\_builder\_admin

For information on granular roles, see [Granular admin roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/granular-admin-roles.md).

**Note:** Upload a custom font family before adding individual font faces. This ensures each style is correctly grouped under its font family.

## About this task

Font faces are applied individually to components, as needed. Theme Builder does not yet support variable type fonts.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Now Experience Framework** &gt; **Theme Builder**.

    The Theme Builder landing page appears in the Home page view.

2.  Use the Page drop-down list to select the Editor page view.

3.  From the Theme drop-down list, select the theme that you want to edit.

    The **Global styles** tab opens automatically with the Overview panel displayed.

    \[Omitted image "tb-editor-page-view.png"\] Alt text: Example view of the Editor page.

4.  Under **Manage custom fonts**, locate and expand the font family where you want to add a font face.

    **Note:** You can also add the font face directly from the Typography panel.

    \[Omitted image "tb-typography-icon.png"\] Alt text: Global styles Typography panel.

5.  From the **Add font face** field, select the Plus sign.

    \[Omitted image "tb-plus-icon.png"\] Alt text: Add font face field with Plus sign highlighted.

    The Add font face modal appears.

6.  Select **Browse**, choose your font face file from your computer's file browser, and select **Open**.

    Alternatively, drag your font face file from your computer's file browser and drop the file directly into the modal.

    **Note:** Make sure that the font face meets the following guidelines or the file isn’t saved.

    -   Under 2 MB
    -   WOFF, TTF format
7.  Select **Save**.

    The new font face is displayed under your custom font family.
