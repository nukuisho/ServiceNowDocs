Establish a centralized library of agencies for identifying the relevant regulatory authorities that are responsible for overseeing particular industries or sectors within each jurisdiction. The centralized library consolidates all the regulatory communications via emails and implements the notification rules for the data privacy or security breaches for the reported compliance cases.

-   **[Auto-calculate future dates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-calculate-future-dates&family=xanadu&ft:locale=en-US)**

-   **[Smart assessments in Compliance Case Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=smart-assessment-in-ccm&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Utilize the Smart Assessment Engine to assess if your employees are compliant with the necessary regulations. The compliance case administrator configures the questionnaire, and when an action task moves from the **Draft** to the **Assigned** state, the assessment is sent. After the assessment, the compliance case manager examines the nature of the non-compliance and its impact on the organization. Based on the findings, appropriate remediation measures are identified and implemented to resolution. To use the smart assessment, a new property called enable\_smart\_assessments \(sn\_grc\_case\_mgmt.enable\_smart\_assessments\) is introduced with the default value as **true**.

-   **[Unified Task-driven UI experience](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=perform-smart-assessment-on-action-task&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

As a business user, use the **Tasks** page on the Employee Center for a consolidated view of all your tasks, enabling you to access and complete them efficiently. This page provides an easy way to manage all your assessments in one place, enabling you to view and perform tasks seamlessly.

-   **[Report a compliance case anonymously](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=report-compliance-case-anonymously&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)Report compliance cases anonymously**

Employees can now use the Anonymous Reporting Center to report compliance violations such as fraud and embezzlement, workplace misconduct \(harassment, discrimination\), bribery and corruption, and other concerns without revealing their identity or location.

Accessed through the Employee Center, the Anonymous Reporting Center portal automatically logs users out to enforce anonymity, creates case records without mapping to employee identity, and provides a unique report key and report number for secure follow-up communication.

CAPTCHA‑based verification is used to authenticate submissions, and the system generates a report statement summarizing the case after submission. Employees can save a copy of their report for future reference. For security and confidentiality, the submitted information is not displayed again. Reports are routed to the appropriate compliance team based on the nature of the concern.

Throughout the investigation process:

    -   Investigators can request additional information through a comments system visible to the reporter
    -   Reporters can follow up on their case using their report key to check progress and respond to questions
    -   All interactions maintain reporter anonymity at every step; no identity or location data is ever captured or linked
This enhancement enables organizations to build trust, mitigate risks before escalation, and ensures regulatory compliance with whistleblower protection requirements.

-   **[Case summarization for compliance cases](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=compliance-case-summarization-skill&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)AI-driven compliance case summarization**

After upgrading Now Assist for Integrated Risk Management \(IRM\) application to version 22.x, Compliance analysts can use the case summarization feature to quickly understand a compliance case without manually reviewing every field, attachment, or related list. Now Assist analyzes key case attributes—such as timelines, impacted areas, evidence, and actions—and generates a structured summary directly inside the compliance case.

This solves a common problem: case data is often lengthy, scattered across multiple related lists, and difficult for analysts to digest efficiently. Analysts can also save and edit summaries as case data evolves, ensuring the record stays current.

By consolidating all relevant information into a single, coherent narrative, Now Assist reduces investigation time, improves consistency across reviewers, and supports faster decision-making.
