# Now Assist context menu

The Now Assist context menu uses generative AI to help agents summarize, create, and edit written content, thus streamlining their writing tasks.

Agents produce various types of content, including emails and chat replies. The Now Assist context menu uses generative AI to assist agents in summarizing, creating, and editing emails and chat replies. Agents can preview AI generated content, scroll through previously created content, and refine the text using the AI. The Now Assist context menu can be triggered from any application or field in a ServiceNow workspace where the Now Assist context menu is enabled.

The Now Assist context menu unlocks the power of generative AI and is available in Next Experience for:

-   Customer Service Management \(CSM\)
-   Human Resources \(HR\)
-   IT Service Management \(ITSM\)
-   Strategic Portfolio Management \(SPM\)
-   IT Operations Management \(ITOM\)

The Now Assist context menu isn't available for Core UI or in any Service Portal, whether you use custom or built-in skills.

## Using the Now Assist context menu

The Now Assist context menu is available on any field where the floating Now Assist button \(\[Omitted image "wwna-icon.png"\] Alt text: Now Assist context menu icon\) appears. If you start typing in the field, a menu appears with the available Now Assist context menu actions. The Now Assist context menu helps you summarize, create or modify existing documentation.

You can configure the Advanced filter to hide or show the Now Assist Context Menu quick actions option using the wwna\_quick\_actions table.

-   **Limit the number of content refinement calls using the Now Assist context menu**

    Configure and limit the number of content refinements to the skill per session using the Now Assist context menu. By default, the maximum number of refinements isn’t set and you can configure to limit it.

    You can configure the refinement calls limitation at the **Recommendations Dialog Props** field in the **Limit refinements** record using the **refineCount** property.

    **Note:** The **Limit refinements** record is available in the Now Assist config var set record in the Now Assist Skill context menu application.

    \[Omitted image "nacm-limit-refines.png"\] Alt text: Configure the content refine limits to using the refineCount property.

    You can set the refineCount as follows:

    -   The default value of the property is **-1**. If the value is less than 0, then the number of refinements to the skill are unlimited.
    -   If you provide 0 as the value, then the refine button will be disabled and the `You reached the limit for refining content.` message is displayed.

        \[Omitted image "nacm-refineCount-zero.png"\] Alt text: The content refinement limited to zero or the refinements reached the maximum count.

    -   If you configure it with a value greater than 0, you’ll be able to refine the content according to the set value. For example, if you set the refineCount to 2, then you will be able to refine the content only twice.

        \[Omitted image "nacm-refineCount-configured.png"\] Alt text: The content refinement limit value set to two.
