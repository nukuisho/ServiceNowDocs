# Create a tool from Knowledge Graph

Create a tool from Knowledge Graph to expose it to Model Context Protocol \(MCP\) clients from an MCP Server. Knowledge Graph provides agents with accurate, relationship-aware access to live instance data. This enables more precise, context-aware responses in every workflow by directly querying relationships.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_mcp\_server.tools\_admin, sn\_mcp\_server.admin, or admin

See [Exploring Knowledge Graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/knowledge-graph/exploring-knowledge-graph.md) to explore Enterprise graphs and learn about creating Knowledge Graph.

## Procedure

1.  Select Knowledge Graph from these categories.

    \[Omitted image "mcp-create-tool-moveworks.png"\] Alt text: Tool creation

2.  On the form, fill in the fields.

    **Note:** The **category** is auto-populated if selected in the last modal.

<table id="table_l2y_lhm_hgc"><thead><tr><th>

Description

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Knowledge Graph

</td><td>

Select a Knowledge Graph type from the list. You can either choose Enterprise Graph or one of the custom graphs.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Label

</td><td>

An internal name for the tool.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MCP app

</td><td>

An active MCP app linked to this knowledge graph tool.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Description

</td><td>

The description of what the tool intends to do. This input is exposed to AI clients and used to determine when to call this tool.

**Note:** Admins must add specific and action-oriented description as the AI clients access it to decide when to invoke the tool.

</td></tr><tr><td>

MCP Servers

</td><td>

One or more servers you want to add your tool to.

</table>    In the Tool inputs section, the fields associated with the capability are added. \[Omitted image "mcp-server-create-tool-kg-toolinput.png"\] Alt text: Tool input for Knowledge graph

    -   anchortables: Use one or more table names to make your query more specific when you select Enterprise Graph or Enterprise Graph \(small\). This is helpful when you know which tables are relevant to your question. This is an optional field.
    -   tags: Include one or more tags to prioritize a specific group of tables. For example, you can use tags like 'CSM', 'HR'. These tags are required for the Enterprise Graph and Enterprise Graph \(small\) though they are only mandatory for the latter. See [Create Knowledge Graph tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/knowledge-graph/create-knowledge-graph-tags.md) for details on creating Knowledge Graph tags.

    See [Create a tool for a Model Context Protocol server](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/create-tool-mcp-server.md) to learn more. The tool is now published on the MCP Server and discoverable by MCP clients.
