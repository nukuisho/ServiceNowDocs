# Now Assist skills

Now Assist products provide generative AI skills that are tailored to meet the needs of users in different workflows.

The following sections describe the available Now Assist skills.

By default, all skills exist in the global domain. When you use AI in a domain-separated environment, users are only able to access data in their domain. For example, if a user uses the summarization skill, AI only uses material that exists in the user's domain when generating that summary. Additionally, there is no co-mingling of data for domain-separated instances when using generative AI skills. The data resides only on the instance, and the shared services used for generative AI do not persist any requests \(prompts\) and responses. For more information, see [Domain separation in the Now Assist Admin console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/domain-separation-in-the-now-assist-admin-console.md). \(Note that global domain is not the same as global scope. For more information, see [Exploring Next Experience pickers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-pickers.md).\)

**Important:** Some generative AI skills, AI agents, and agentic workflows are turned on by default. For more information, see [Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

**Note:** Some workflow skills support Now Assist functionality. Deactivating these skills may negatively impact some features.

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

## Now Assist skills overview

Now Assist skills are discrete, reusable generative AI capabilities that perform a specific type of work within a workflow. A skill focuses on a single, well‑defined task, such as summarizing content, generating text, analyzing records, or providing recommendations, and returns an output that can be reviewed, used, or acted on by a user or workflow.

Skills are the foundational AI building blocks used across Now Assist experiences, workflows, and products. They enable AI‑powered assistance without requiring custom model development.

## What a skill does

Skills are designed to:

-   Perform one focused action

    A skill handles a specific task, such as summarizing a record, generating a response, or analyzing data, rather than completing an end to end workflow.

-   Operate within an existing workflow or product context

    Skills are used in the context of where users work, such as records, tasks, forms, or panels, and act on the data available in that context.

-   Use generative AI safely and securely

    Skills run on the ServiceNow AI Platform and respect data boundaries, access controls, and domain separation.

-   Return usable output

    The output of a skill can be reviewed by the user, edited if needed, or used to support downstream actions in a workflow.


## How users interact with skills

Depending on the product and configuration, users can interact with skills in different ways:

-   Triggering a skill from a contextual UI, such as a panel or record.
-   Using a skill as part of a workflow driven experience.
-   Receiving output generated automatically by a workflow or agentic process.

In all cases, skills are designed to assist, not replace, user decision making by reducing manual effort.

**Note:** Some skills are turned on by default, depending on the product and release. Other skills require explicit enablement or configuration in the Now Assist admin experience. Deactivating certain skills may impact dependent features or workflows.
