        The Access keys are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root user. Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID and a secret access key. For detailed information, see [how to get access and secret key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).

    4.  Enter the **AWS Region**.

        **Note:** The region information is available in the navigation bar of the AWS management console and this can be a comma separated field. So, you can enter multiple regions.
