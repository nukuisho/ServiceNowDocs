# ServiceNow Otto for Telecommunications, Media, and Technology \(TMT\) draft and schedule touchpoint meetings agentic workflow

Use the Draft and schedule touchpoint meetings agentic workflow to schedule and edit a touchpoint meeting for a specific user.

## Draft and schedule touchpoint meetings agentic workflow overview

The agentic workflow enables customer success agents to optimize meeting schedules within the customer success workflow by creating and managing meetings. It create and manage meetings based on key details such as invitees, agenda, meeting type, and scheduling preferences. With this agentic workflow, customer success managers can:

-   Take timely and contextual action.
-   Create a meeting with all required details.
-   Schedule draft meetings without manual coordination.

The meeting AI plugin \(app-meeting-ai-ag\) installs automatically with the Customer Success AI agent.

**Important:** In the ServiceNow Otto skills page, make sure to Activate the meeting proposal generator skill to trigger the agentic workflow. See [Activate a skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/activate-skill.md) for more details.

When the risk record's probability is very high or occurred, the customer success agent assigned to that risk receives a ServiceNow Otto panel notification. The agentic workflow automates the creation and scheduling of the meeting.

The Meeting AI plugin supports these tables:

-   Touchpoint \(sn\_acct\_lc\_touchpoint\)
-   Account Onboarding Case \(sn\_acct\_lc\_onb\_case\)
-   Engagement \(sn\_acct\_lc\_engagement\)
-   Customer Account \(customer\_account\)
-   Risk Signal and Issue \(sn\_acct\_lc\_risk\_signal\_issue\)

**Note:** To create the meeting AI plugin extensible to other business units, see [KB3119608](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?sys_kb_id=696e678cc37d8fd4a9ea601bb0013170&id=kb_article_view).

To modify the Draft and schedule touchpoint meetings agentic workflow [Duplicate an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/clone-aia-usecase.md), and adjust the settings according to your requirements.

**Note:** You can use Now LLM Service, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini or Anthropic Claude on AWS as the AI model provider for all ServiceNow Otto skills and AI agents. Use the Configuration Controls in [AI Control tower](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-model-providers.md) to define which options are available, then set the skill-level preferences in the [AI Admin Hub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/manage-large-language-models.md). For more information, see [Large language models on the ServiceNow AI Platform®](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/exploring-large-language-models.md).

## Role masking

Required role: sn\_acct\_lc.customer\_success\_agent

Agentic workflows and their AI agents use [role masking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/aia-role-masking.md) to determine which users can access them. Ones installed with your applications have specific roles that come included with the application. If you select **Users with specific roles** for user access, you must configure the security controls to include these roles. For the instructions to change the security controls, see [Define security controls for an agentic workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/define-sec-controls-aw.md).
