# Approve or reject a service order for fulfillment

Select a service order and review the account, contact, and date details to verify that the order is correct and complete. If you're a service order manager, you can approve or reject a service order with a New state for fulfillment.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.service\_order\_manager

## About this task

**Note:** If the following error message appears in the San Diego release or above after approving an order, it indicates that a required upgrade script was not run.

```
Some of the OMT tables need reparenting. Please contact administrator to execute the reparenting script.
```

The Post Upgrade Script performs required order management table reparenting and column promotion. If the script hasn't been run, the order decomposition and order fulfillment functions won't function as designed until your system administrator runs it. To learn more, see [Restructured Order Management tables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/telecom-media-technology/restructured-order-mgt-tables-san-diego.md).
