# Review the line items and related details for a service order

Review the line items and the related details of the selected service order to make sure that all line items and details are correct and complete. The related details include the service order line item characteristics and contacts.

## Before you begin

Role required: order\_approver, order\_viewer, sn\_ind\_tmt\_orm.service\_order\_manager

## About this task

By using the Order Line Item and Order Characteristic forms together, you can do the following actions:

-   View an existing service order line item.
-   View, add, change, or delete a new characteristic of a service order line item. To learn more, see [Select, review, revise, or request cancellation of a service order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/telecom-media-technology/service-order-mgt-review-service-order-detail.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Service Order Management** &gt; **Workspace** &gt; **Configurable Workspace Home**.

    **Note:** If you aren't using configurable workspaces, navigate by using the following path:

    **Workspace Experience** &gt; **Workspaces** &gt; **Agent Workspace Home**.

    To learn more about migrating to configurable workspaces, see [Migrate to Configurable Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/customer-service-management/migrate-to-configurable-workspace.md).

    If you have an assigned Service Order Manager or Service Order Agent role, the Service Order Management workspace appears. If the Service Order Management workspace doesn't appear, do the following actions:

    1.  From the Configuration Workspace Lists icon \[Omitted image "list-outline-24.svg"\] Alt text:, click **Service Orders**.
    2.  Do one of the following:

        -   To view all service orders, click **All**.
        -   To view only open, unfulfilled service orders, click **Open**.
        **Note:** To learn more about creating or updating service order details, see [Creating orders in Order Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/creating-orders-som.md).

    3.  Select the service order that you want to review, verify, and approve:
        -   To refresh the form, click the refresh icon \[Omitted image "form-refresh.png"\] Alt text:.
        -   To filter existing service orders, click the filter icon \[Omitted image "form-filter.png"\] Alt text:.
2.  In the Service Order Management workspace, to select the service order, click the appropriate tile.

3.  After selecting and opening the service order in the Customer Order form, click **Order Line Items \(n\)** to view the service order line item details.

    \(n\) represents the number of the total number of line items for the service order. The Order Line Items form appears.

4.  In the **Order Line** field, select an existing service order line item to review.

5.  On the form, review the details for the selected service order line item.

6.  To save any updates that you made to the service order line item, click **Save**.


## What to do next

As needed, review and update the related contact, order characteristic values, and order tasks.

**Note:**

If you create a manual fallout record or an automated one is generated for the order tasks, you can easily review and track all fallout records for a specific order. Use the **Fallouts \(n\)** tab \(where n is the number of fallouts\) that appears when you view the related customer or service order in the Customer Order form.

To learn more about order fallout, see [Managing order fallout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/order-management/fallout-management-overview.md).
