</table>6.  Select **Continue**.

    The system sends the customer an email that summarizes the dispute, investigation findings, and proposed resolution.

7.  Add the feedback from the customer in the **Resolution notes** field.

8.  Record the customer's response by selecting **Customer accepted** or **Customer rejected**.

    If the customer accepted the resolution, select **Customer accepted** and the dispute moves to the closure step. If the customer rejected the resolution, select **Customer rejected**. You are prompted to generate a deadlock letter before the dispute moves to closure.

9.  To generate a deadlock letter, draft the letter content and select **Generate and send**.

    **Note:** If you are using the ServiceNow Otto for TMT application, you can generate the deadlock letter details using the ServiceNow Otto component. To learn more, see [Generate a deadlock letter using ServiceNow Otto for TMT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/telecom-media-technology/now-assist-for-telecom-media-and-technology/now-assist-tmt-generate-deadlock-letter.md).

    The system creates a PDF of the letter, sends it to the customer by email, and adds the PDF to the dispute's attachments. The sent email is displayed at the Notify regulator step.

    When a deadlock letter is generated after a customer rejection, the dispute's resolution code and status are set to **Resolved rejected: Deadlock letter generated**.

10. Enter the closing information for the dispute, then select **Save**.
