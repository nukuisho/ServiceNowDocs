# Now Assist for Sales CRM for Telecommunications AI agent Image to task plan template AI agent

Use the AI agent to create a task plan template for a given specification based on the uploaded image file.

## Image to task plan template AI agent overview

This agent processes uploaded image file, extract tasks and tasks dependencies and store them as a task plan template for a given specification and order action.

The AI agent integrates with order action catalogs, file upload services, and template management systems to produce standardized task plan templates with dependency graphs and action mappings. NOW LLM does not support this agent.

The uploaded image should define the tasks and the tasks flow and dependency in a clear chart, with clear text visualization.

From the image the agent always expects the first node or the root node as the specification and not tasks and all others will be tasks.
