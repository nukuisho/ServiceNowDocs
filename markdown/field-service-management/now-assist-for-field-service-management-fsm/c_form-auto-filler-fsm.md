# ServiceNow AI Lens form auto-filler

The ServiceNow AI Lens form auto-filler uses AI image recognition to populate form fields from photos that field service technicians capture in the ServiceNow Agent mobile application. Technicians can auto-fill Input Forms and Scripted Input Forms, such as Smart Assessment questionnaires.

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

## ServiceNow AI Lens form auto-filler

The ServiceNow AI Lens form auto-filler reduces the effort of manually entering data by using AI image recognition to extract information from photos and populate form fields automatically.

The feature is a direct implementation of the platform-level ServiceNow AI Lens capability for Field Service Management. Technicians access it from a **Lens Launcher** button on supported forms, or from the ServiceNow AI Lens topic in Now Assist Virtual Agent.

## Supported form types

The ServiceNow AI Lens form auto-filler is available on the following form types in the ServiceNow Agent mobile application:

-   **Input Forms**

    Technicians can launch ServiceNow AI Lens from a record-based Input Form to auto-populate fields with extracted image data.

-   **Scripted Input Forms**

    Technicians can launch ServiceNow AI Lens from a Scripted Input Form, such as Smart Assessment questionnaires to auto-populate fields based on the form's underlying script.


## ServiceNow AI Lens in Now Assist Virtual Agent

Technicians can use in-form auto-fill or access ServiceNow AI Lens through Now Assist Virtual Agent \(NAVA\) in the ServiceNow Agent mobile application. In this process, the technician selects ServiceNow AI Lens from the NAVA topic picker, uploads or captures an image, and receives a text summary response. This flow does not auto-fill form fields. For more information, see [Use ServiceNow AI Lens in Now Assist Virtual Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/now-assist-for-field-service-management-fsm/c_form-auto-filler-fsm.md).

## Plugins

The ServiceNow AI Lens form auto-filler requires the following plugins:

-   `com.sn_ai_lens` — Platform ServiceNow AI Lens plugin.
-   `com.sn.fsm.gen.ai` — Now Assist for FSM plugin. Controls access to the Lens Launcher icon on FSM forms.
-   `com.snc.fsm_smart_asmt_questionnaire` — Smart Assessment Questionnaire plugin. Required for Lens Launcher on Smart Assessment questionnaires.
-   `com.snc.app_lens_util_pack` — Defines who can use the feature, how data is processed, and the field types that ServiceNow AI Lens can populate.

## Auto-fill a form with ServiceNow AI Lens

Use ServiceNow AI Lens to auto-fill form fields by capturing or uploading an image in the ServiceNow Agent mobile app. The Lens Launcher is available on Input Forms and Scripted Input Forms, such as Smart Assessment questionnaires.

### Before you begin

Role required: wm\_agent, which inherits the lens\_user role.

### About this task

Auto-filling a form with ServiceNow AI Lens reduces manual data entry on a job site. Capture an image of an asset, document, or equipment, and ServiceNow AI Lens populates the relevant form fields from the image.

**Note:** Review AI-populated form fields for accuracy before submitting. AI-generated results may not be accurate in all cases.

These steps cover filling a Smart Assessment questionnaire for a work order task. The same steps apply when using ServiceNow AI Lens Launcher to fill Input Forms and Scripted Input Forms.

### Procedure

1.  Log in to the ServiceNow Agent mobile application.

2.  Select **My Work**.

3.  In the **My Tasks** section, select **See All**.

4.  Select the required task.

5.  Select **Start work**.

6.  Select **Take questionnaire**.

    The questionnaire associated with the work order task is displayed.

7.  Select the questionnaire to start filling it.

8.  Select the Lens icon \[Omitted image "use-form-auto-filler-fsm.png"\] Alt text: in the toolbar.

9.  In the **Add files** section, select the file to scan, such as an image, from your local device.

    You can add multiple files to be scanned at once, but the limit is 10.

10. Select the Camera icon \[Omitted image "form-auto-filler-fsm-upload.png"\] Alt text: to capture an image with your device camera and add it for scanning.

11. Select **Add** to directly add the files for scanning or **View selected** to review the files before adding.

12. After the files are added, in the ServiceNow AI Lens page, select **Start**.


### Result

After the files are successfully scanned, some of the fields in the questionnaire are automatically filled. You can review the values and edit them, if required.

### What to do next

If ServiceNow AI Lens cannot process the image, one of the following error messages appears:

<table id="table_lhg_55j_kjc"><thead><tr><th>
