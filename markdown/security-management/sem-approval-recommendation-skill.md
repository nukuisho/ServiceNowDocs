# Generate approval recommendations with generative AI

Use a generative AI skill to streamline the approval process for exceptions and false positive requests with AI-driven recommendations. Reduce manual effort and improve decision accuracy for your approvers in the Security Exposure Management Workspace.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

The ServiceNow Otto® panel must be activated. For more information, see [Activate the ServiceNow Otto panel standard chat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/activate-now-assist-panel.md).

**Important:** This generative AI skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [AI agents, skills, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

Role required: sn\_sec\_exception.approver

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Security Exposure Management** &gt; **List** &gt; **Approvals**.

2.  Select a request from the **All Approvals** list or from one of the widgets.

    **Note:** You can select any type of request except the requests related to exception rules.

3.  Select **Otto Recommendation** from the side panel to generate tailored recommendations for this request.

4.  Review the generated recommendations displayed in the **Otto Recommendation** panel.

5.  Select **Approve** or **Reject** at the top corner of the screen based on the tailored recommendations for this request.
