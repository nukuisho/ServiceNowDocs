-   \(Optional\) If you want to use the AI guardrails helper skill and agentic workflow you must install the Now Assist for Vulnerability Response application \(sn\_vul\_ai\).
-   Vulnerability Response and Configuration Compliance for Containers \(sn\_vul\_container\)
-   Vulnerability Response \(sn\_vul\)
-   Configuration Compliance \(sn\_vulc\)

At least one of these AI defense integrations supported by the application must be installed and activated.
