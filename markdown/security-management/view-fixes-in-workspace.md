# View fixes in USEM Workspace

Review the fixes that Fix Intelligence for SEM has identified, and see the findings and assets each one resolves. A Fix record represents a single remediation action that resolves one or more findings.

## Before you begin

Role required: `sn_vul_fix.read`, or a Vulnerability Response role that contains it.

Prerequisites:

-   ServiceNow Support has configured the Armis Centrix™ for ViPR integration, and at least one sync has completed. See [Install Fix Intelligence for Security Exposure Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/install-fix-intel.md).

## About this task

Fixes appear in Unified Security Exposure Management Workspace as a list and a form. For general workspace navigation, such as opening lists and using the Remediation view, see the linked USEM Workspace topics; this task covers only what is specific to fixes.

## Procedure

1.  Open Unified Security Exposure Management Workspace.

2.  Open the **Remediation overview** and select the **Fix Intelligence** tab.

    The **Fix Intelligence** tab summarizes findings that have a fix identified, the number of unique fixes, and the top fixes to act on. To review the fixes themselves, open the Fix list from this tab or select **View All** on a widget.

3.  Open the Fix list.

    The list shows each fix with its **Description**, **Findings** count, **Assets** count, **Risk rating**, **Risk score**, **Remediation category**, and **Software package**.

4.  Select a fix to open its form.

    The form header highlights the fix description with its assets, findings, remediation category, and risk rating; the risk rating is color-coded from Critical to None.

    From the fix, you can review the following information:

    -   General information \(software package and version, remediation category, and finding category\).
    -   Vulnerable items the fix remediates.
    -   The remediation task that groups those findings, if one exists.
5.  Review the fix's fields to understand what it remediates and how much risk it removes.

    For what each field means, see [Understanding Fix records](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/understanding-fix-records.md).


## Result

You can see the ingested fixes and the scope of each one.
