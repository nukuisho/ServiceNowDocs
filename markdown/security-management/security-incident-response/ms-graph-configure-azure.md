# Configure the Microsoft Azure portal

To retrieve security alerts for an application available in the Microsoft Azure tenant using the Microsoft Graph Security API, you must register the application in the Microsoft Azure portal and grant security event read and write access to the application.

## Before you begin

Role required:

-   Application Developer: Required for registering the application.
-   Tenant Administrator: The Microsoft Azure tenant administrator must grant permissions to the application by making a call to the admin consent endpoint.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the Microsoft Azure portal.

2.  Enter **App registrations** in the **Search** box.

3.  Select **New registration**.

4.  Enter a name for your application and the redirect URI, for example http://localhost and click **Register**.

    The Redirect URI is used while providing admin consent for the application.

5.  In the App registrations page, select the application you have registered, for example Graph Security Demo.

6.  Under **Manage**, select **Certificates &amp; secrets**.

7.  Select **New client secret** to create a client secret.

    Copy the client secret and save it as it will not be visible later. In case you forgot the client secret you can generate a new client secret.

    **Note:** If you forget the client secret, you can generate a new one by following the instructions in steps 4 and 5.

8.  Select **View API Permissions** in the Overview page.

9.  Add new Application level API permissions for SecurityAlert.ReadWrite.All security events.

    The steps are given below:

        Enter the APPLICATION\_ID of the application that you have registered.

12. Select **Accept** to accept permissions requested by the application created above.

    You can then use the application to read security events. See the [Microsoft Graph Security Authorization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference) documentation for more details.
