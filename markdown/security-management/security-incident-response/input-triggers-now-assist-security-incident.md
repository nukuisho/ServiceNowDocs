# Inputs and triggers

You can configure some of the inputs or triggers for a generative AI skill. Inputs or triggers permit you to determine how and when a skill is used.

## Inputs and triggers

Inputs identify the data used for a skill. Inputs include the table and fields used to generate a security incident summary. A trigger initiates an action. For example, triggers determine when the system generates a summary.

You can modify inputs and triggers, but you can't modify a skill's data source. The data source contains the tables and fields that the skill relies on.

## Security incident summarization skill

Inputs for the security incident summarization skill identify the table and fields used when a security incident summary is generated. The following table lists the inputs for the Security Incident summarization skill from the Choose Input page in the AI Admin Hub console.

</table>## Resolution notes generation skill

Inputs for the Resolution notes generation skill identify the table and fields that are used when the resolution notes are generated for a security incident. The following table lists the inputs for the resolution notes generation skill from the Choose Input page in the AI Admin Hub console.
