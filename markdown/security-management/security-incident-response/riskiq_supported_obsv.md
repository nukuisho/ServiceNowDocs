title: Supported observables for RISKIQ and RISKIQ WHOISIQ
description: The RISKIQ API supports automatic SSL certificate lookups on IP address, file hash, Certificate Serial Number, domain, and URL observables. URL and domain observables are enriched automatically with the WHOISIQ API. For observable enrichment on other types of observables with the WHOISIQ API, create observables and run lookups manually from the Observables table.

# Supported observables for RISKIQ and RISKIQ WHOISIQ

The RISKIQ API supports automatic SSL certificate lookups on IP address, file hash, Certificate Serial Number, domain, and URL observables. URL and domain observables are enriched automatically with the WHOISIQ API. For observable enrichment on other types of observables with the WHOISIQ API, create observables and run lookups manually from the Observables table.

## Supported observables

The following table lists the type of APIs used in this integration, and the observables each API supports. The table also indicates whether a lookup occurs automatically when security incidents are created, or if the lookup is run manually from the Observables table.

RISKIQ SSL certificate API

</td><td>

-   IP address
-   File hash \(certificate thumb print\). See the following figure for an example of a file hash.
-   Certificate Serial Number, or Serial Number. This string is a unique ID for the entity. See the following figure for an example of a certificate serial number.
-   Domain \(`www.site.com`, or `site.com`\)
-   URL

**Note:** automatic scans are run for the URL format using the `https://` protocol, for example,`https://example.com/index.html`
