# Preview security incident for the Splunk Enterprise Event Ingestion integration

After you complete the mapping step, preview the values that you mapped in a ServiceNow AI Platform® Security Incident Response \(SIR\) security incident. This preview step permits you to verify that you have mapped all the alert fields that you want displayed on the security incident.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_si.ingestion\_profile\_admin

**Note:** Users with the sn\_si.admin role can perform all operations available to a profile admin, as the sn\_si.admin role inherits the required permissions by default.

## About this task

Preview a security incident and edit the mapping again as required to fix fields with errors or to populate any missing data. If the preview is not successfully completed, you cannot proceed to the scheduling step. Previews of SIR security incidents are not saved as actual incidents in the SIR product.

## Procedure

1.  If the security incident preview is not displayed, select **Preview** in the progress bar.

2.  Select the **Alert Name** and then select an item from the **Sample Alert IDs** list.

    \[Omitted image "214\_select\_ID\_previewsplunk.png"\] Alt text: Select alert choice list expanded.

    The security incident is displayed. Do not change any information in the fields. This view is a read-only view, and a record of this security incident is not saved.

3.  Review the field mapping of the alert values on the security incident.

    \[Omitted image "214SplunkProfilePreviewPage.png"\] Alt text: Error message on a security incident in the preview.

    The preceding image is an example of a preview with a mapping error. In this example, a field on the security incident does not exist for a value, or the field does not support the value that you mapped.

4.  To resolve this error, select **Mapping** in the progress bar.

5.  Edit the mapping to fix incorrect values or populate any missing data.

6.  Preview the mapping again and continue to fix any errors that are described in error messages.

    The following figure is an example of the Incident Details tab on the bottom half of a SIR security incident after all error messages are resolved. For this example, the Description and Work notes fields were mapped, and these fields are populated with the values from the value pairs pulled from the Splunk Enterprise console. The first Work notes field has no value. This field was left empty on the mapping grid during the mapping step. The additional Work Note fields that have values were added to the mapping grid during the mapping step.

    **Note:** The Profile Preview section displays related items for **Unmatched Affected User** and **Unmatched Configuration Item** when matching CMDB or identity records are not found. After ingestion, Security Incident records show **Unmatched CI** in the **Configuration Items** related list and **Unmatched Affected Users** in a dedicated related list, ensuring complete visibility of affected entities throughout the incident life-cycle.

7.  After you have fixed any errors and verified that the fields are the way you want them, choose one option to continue.
