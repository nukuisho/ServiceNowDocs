</td></tr><tr><td id="d290232e114">

</td></tr><tr><td id="d290232e132">

**Redirect URL**

</td><td>

The callback URL that the authorization server redirects to. Enter as many URLs as needed for all possible token consumers. The instance matches the URL of the incoming request to one of the redirect URLs. If no match is made, the instance uses the first redirect URL.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d290232e142">

**Logo URL**

</td><td>

The URL that contains an image to use as the application logo. The logo appears on the approval page when the user receives a request to grant a client application access to a restricted resource on the instance.
