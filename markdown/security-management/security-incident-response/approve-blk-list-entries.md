# Approve block list entries for the Check Point NGTP integration

An approval process for Block List entries is part of the preconfigured workflow. You approve Block List entries before the entries are activated on Block Lists. After you approve the Block List entry, the Gateway retrieves the entry, and your observable is blocked from that point forward.

## Before you begin

-   Approval for Block List entries is assigned to Security Incident Administrator \(sn\_si.admin\) by default, but this authority can be assigned as required by your organization. In the following example, the ServiceNow AI Platform admin has approval authority.

Role required: sn.si.admin

## About this task

When the approval process is enabled, a Block List entry is not activated or deactivated on the Block List until it is approved.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Check Point NGTP Integration** &gt; **Block Request List Entries**, and open the Block List Entry record.

2.  On the Block List Entry record, scroll to the **Approval Requests** section.

After the entry is retrieved, the observable is blocked from that point forward.
