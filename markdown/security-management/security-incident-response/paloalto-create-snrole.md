# Create the API account role for Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall

An API account role is required in your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance for this integration. The Username and Password associated with this account are created in the ServiceNow AI Platform® and entered in Palo Alto Networks so the Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall authenticates with the ServiceNow AI Platform® when retrieving EDL entries.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The ServiceNow AI Platform® admin creates an API account role \(sn\_sec\_panfw.api\_account\_access\). This account is used exclusively for entering credentials required for authentication on Palo Alto Networks so the firewalls can retrieve EDLs from the ServiceNow AI Platform®. This account is a separate, unique API user account in the ServiceNow AI Platform® instance, and assigned to the Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall administrator.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Organization** &gt; **Users**.

2.  Select the **Users** module.

3.  On the Users list that is displayed, select **New**.

    A new user form is displayed.

4.  Fill in the form.

    **Note:** The values for User ID title, and email address shown in the following table and figure are example values.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |User ID|Unique User ID for the role in your ServiceNow AI Platform® instance. This user ID is entered in the **Username** field in the **Client Authentication** section of the External Dynamic Lists dialog on the Palo Alto Networks site. An example is `API account SN`.|
    |First name|Person you're assigning.|
    |Last name|Person you're assigning.|
    |Title|Job title, for example, `FW admin`.|
    |Password|Unique password created for this role. This password is entered in the **Password** field in the **Client Authentication** section of the External Dynamic Lists dialog on the Palo Alto Networks site.|
    |Email|Unique email address.|

5.  Select **Submit**.

    Once submitted, you can assign the role.

6.  On the Users list in the **User ID** column, select the name of the user ID you entered, `API account SN`, for example.

7.  On the open record in the Roles section, select **Edit**.

8.  On the **Edit Members** form that is displayed, enter `sn_sec_panfw.api_account_access` in the **Collection** field.

9.  In the **Collection** column, select then move `sn_sec_panfw.api_account_access` to the **Roles List**.

10. Select **Save**.

11. Navigate to **Users**, and in the **User** column on the list, select the ID name that you created for the role \(`API account SN`\).

    The user record is displayed. This record verifies that the user account has been assigned. The **State** is active, and the role is not inherited.
