# Early Warning CVD Attributes field reference

The Early Warning CVD Attributes table stores threat intelligence signals for vulnerabilities. Each attribute represents a pre-disclosure threat indicator ingested from the Early Warning feed.

Early warning threat signals are stored in the Armis Early Warning CVD Attributes \[sn\_vul\_ew\_cvd\_attributes\] table, a specialized extension table for vulnerability attributes. Each record in this table represents a unique CVE and stores the set of threat intelligence attributes ingested from Armis.
