# Components installed with Fix Intelligence for Security Exposure Management

Activating the Fix Intelligence for Security Exposure Management plugin \(`sn_vul_fix`\) installs the following tables, role, scripts, automation, and integration components.

## Tables

|Table|Purpose|
|-----|-------|
|`sn_vul_fix_intel` \(Fix\)|Stores one record per unique fix.|
|`sn_vul_fix_cache`|Link cache used to compute finding links per sync.|
|`sn_vul_fix_download_queue`|Work queue of sync files to download.|
|`sn_vul_fix_import`|Import-set staging table for inbound fix data.|

The plugin also adds a read-only `fix_intel` reference column to the Vulnerability Response `sn_vul_vulnerable_item` and `sn_vul_vulnerability` tables, and to the Remediation Task table.

## Role

`sn_vul_fix.read` grants read access to the Fix tables. It is contained by the Vulnerability Response read roles, so existing VR users inherit it.

## Automation and integration

-   **Poll and Store Fix Intelligence Data** flow and its action, triggered on a scheduled timer.
-   A business rule set that advances the sync watermark, triggers the risk rollup, drives fix-based grouping, and derives the risk rating.
-   A scheduled job that bootstraps the Fix Intelligence for SEM dashboard widgets and then disables itself.
-   The **Fix Intelligence Connection** connection alias and outbound REST message, which ServiceNow Support configures.
