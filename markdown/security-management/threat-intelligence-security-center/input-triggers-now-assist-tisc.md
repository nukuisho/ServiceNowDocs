# Inputs and triggers for Now Assist for Threat Intelligence Security Center

You can configure some of the inputs or triggers for a generative AI skill. Inputs or triggers permit you to determine how and when a skill is used.

## Inputs and triggers

Inputs identify the data used for a skill. Inputs include the table and fields used to generate a threat case summary. A trigger initiates an action. For example, triggers determine when the system generates a summary.

You can modify inputs and triggers, but you can't modify a skill's data source. The data source contains the tables and fields that the skill relies on.

## Case Summarization skill

Inputs for the Case Summarization skill identify the table and fields used when a threat case summary is generated. The following table lists the inputs for the Case Summarization skill from the Choose Input page in the Now Assist Admin console.
