# Summarize a Case with Now Assist for Threat Intelligence Security Center

Use Now Assist for Threat Intelligence Security Center to generate a concise summary of a case, including its key findings and recommended next steps.

## Before you begin

**Important:** Some generative AI skills, AI agents, and agentic workflows are turned on by default. For more information, see [Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

Role required: sn\_sec\_tisc.analyst

## About this task

The Case Summarization skill analyzes the content of a threat case — including linked threat intelligence objects, notes, and activity history — and generates a concise summary. Analysts can review the summary and quickly understand the current state of the case.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center**.

2.  Select the **Threat Analyst Workbench** icon.

3.  In **Case Management**, open the case you want to summarize.

    You can use case summarization for all case statuses, except Draft and Cancelled.

4.  In the **Details** tab, select **Summarize**.

    You can also use the **Summarize Case** option from the Now Assist panel.

    Depending on the available data, the summary includes one or more of the following sections surfacing the prioritized details:

    -   Case overview: Available for all summaries. Contains a brief overview and case details.
    -   Findings: Contain details, such as, Key insights, Top risk indicators, Assets and Services.
    -   Key actions taken: Lists the actions performed by analysts on the case.
    -   Recommended next steps: Lists the possible case mitigation, subsequent procedures, or other next steps.
5.  Select **Share** to open the summary in an editable window and add or remove summary details, and select **Save to work notes**.
