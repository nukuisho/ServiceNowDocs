# Deleting threat intelligence library records

Delete threat intelligence library records such as observables, indicators, and objects.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_sec\_tisc.analyst

The following example procedure explains how to delete an observable record. You can use the same procedure to delete indicators or objects as well.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Threat Intelligence Security Center** &gt; **Threat Intel Library** &gt; **Observables** &gt; **All Observables**.

2.  Open any observable record.

3.  Select **Delete** to delete the aggregated record.

    When you select this action, then it will remove all the related records, except the original source data, and trigger reaggregation.

    A confirmation message will appear to verify that you want to delete the aggregated record. If you also want to delete the source records and prevent re aggregation, select the **Delete Source Records** check box. This action will remove all the associated source records.
