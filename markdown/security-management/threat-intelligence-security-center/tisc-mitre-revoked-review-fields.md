</table>## Review reason values

|Value|Meaning|
|-----|-------|
|Technique has been revoked in the MITRE Collection|MITRE revoked the technique itself, so every tactic that the technique belonged to loses the link.|
|Technique no longer mapped to the Tactic in the MITRE Collection|The technique is still current, but MITRE no longer maps it to this tactic.|

## Status values

|Value|Meaning|
|-----|-------|
|Review|The pair is waiting for you to delete or remap its associations. This value is set when ingestion creates the record.|
|In Progress|An action was requested and is running in the background.|
|Complete|The requested action finished.|
|Error|The background work didn't finish. You can run the action again from the record.|
