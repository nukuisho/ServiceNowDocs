Select the appropriate data parsing mechanism option. The available options are:-   **Automated IoC Extraction**: This option is selected by default when configuring Text, CSV, or JSON feeds.
-   **Custom Field Mapping**: Select this option if you want to define how the specific fields in your feed data should be mapped to the observable attributes.

Once selected, you can configure the mappings in the **Field Mapping** section. For more detailed information on the custom field mapping, see [Configure Custom Field Mapping](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/threat-intelligence-security-center/tisc-field-mapping.md).

**Note:** The data parsing mechanism option is only available for Text, CSV, and JSON feeds, where the feeds **Report Processor** is set to `SimpleFeedDatasourceResponseProcessor`.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Authentication Required

</td><td>

Select this check box if authentication is required for your new threat intelligence feed.**Note:** This is only applicable when REST Endpoint URL is being used to retrieve the data.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Authentication Type

</td><td>

-   API ID / API Secret
-   API Key
-   API Key / API Secret
-   API Username / API Password / API Key
-   Basic Authentication


</td></tr><tr><td>

Headers to be passed with request

</td><td>

Any headers to be passed with the requests can be provided in Request Header Mapping.-   Header should be provided in key-value pair separated by colon\(':'\).
-   Each header key value pair should be provided in a new line.
-   For providing authentication parameters as header values, enclose the required Authentication Label with '$\{' and '\}$'. For example, x-api-key:$\{API Key\}$.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Advanced

</td><td>

Select this check box to define custom integration script and report processor script.**Note:** When you select this check box, the **Integration script** and **Report Processor** fields will appear for you to select the custom scripts.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Integration script

</td><td>

Integration script invokes a call to the REST Endpoint URL using the authentication parameters and the headers as configured in the feed, and then the script fetches the data that is available from the specific feed.Within the base system following are the custom scripts includes available, which are provisioned within the application for the integrations scripts:

-   MITRESourceIntegration: Used for fetching the data from MITRE feeds.
-   RSSFeedDatasourceIntegration: Used for fetching the data from RSS feeds.
-   SimpleFeedDatasourceIntegration: Used for fetching the data from Simple feeds without authentication or Basic Authentication.
-   SimpleMISPFeedDatasourceIntegration: Used for fetching the data from hosted MISP feeds.
The default integration script is based on the feed type that you select. For example, if you select MISP feed type which is a standard format to process and fetch the data then the integrations script is **SimpleMISPFeedDatasourceIntegration**.

**Note:**

For the Custom integration scripts, you can create a script include by extending **FeedDatasourceIntegrationBase** and override the required methods.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Report processor

</td><td>

The report processor script processes data fetched from the feed using the integration script.

 The base system includes the following custom scripts, which are provisioned within the application to support report processor script:

-   AtomFeedDatasourceResponseProcessor: Used for processing RSS feeds in Atom format.
-   MITRECollectionDataProcessor: Used for processing MITRE feeds.
-   RSSFeedDatasourceResponseProcessor: Used for processing RSS feeds.
-   SimpleDataplaneFeedResponseProcessor: Used for processing Dataplane feeds.
-   SimpleFeedDatasourceResponseProcessor: Used for processing Simple feeds using regular expression extraction of observables.
-   SimpleFeodotrackerFeedResponseProcessor: Used for processing Feodotracker feeds.
-   SimpleMISPFeedDatasourceResponseProcessor: Used for processing hosted MISP feeds.
-   TAXIIV2CollectionDataProcessor: Used for processing TAXII Collection data.
 The default report processor for MISP feeds is `SimpleMISPFeedDatasourceResponseProcessor`. This processor is preconfigured by the application and cannot be modified or replaced.

Run

</td><td>

Set the frequency at which you want to ingest the records. The feed will run and execute based on the scheduled job interval. The available job intervals are:-   Daily
-   Weekly
-   Monthly
-   Periodically
-   Once
-   On Demand
-   Business Calendar: Entry Start
-   Business Calendar: Entry End
**Note:** By default, the frequency is set to On Demand.

 For more information, see [Scheduled Jobs and how to Automatically run a script of your choosing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-administration/t_ScheduleAScriptExecution.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Fetch Data From

</td><td>

The start date from when the data needed to be fetched. This field should be set with the time from when the data needs to be ingested from the corresponding source. Once this value is s, the next ingestion run would fetch the data from the configured time and consecutive ingestion runs would fetch incremental Data based on the Run frequency?.For example, Source is scheduled to ingest the data every hour. The user sets **Fetch Data From** to Jan 12 6:00AM on Jan 12 9:30AM, the ingestion triggering on Jan 12 10:00AM would fetch the data from Jan 12 6:00AM to Jan 12 10:00AM. The next ingestion that triggers at 11:00AM would fetch only the incremental data from Jan 12 10:00AM to Jan 12 11:00AM.

**Note:** This means the scheduled runs will fetch data incrementally starting from the specified date onwards.

**Important:** Also, this is not applicable for Text, CSV, and JSON feeds.
