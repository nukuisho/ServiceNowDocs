# Manage MITRE Relationships

Manage the MITRE relationships information that you imported from the MITRE TAXII collections.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_sec\_tisc.analyst

## About this task

MITRE tactics are broad goals, and techniques are the methods used to achieve them. A technique can be linked to more than one tactic. MITRE maintains these tactic-technique mappings and updates them with each release.

When you add a MITRE technique to a case, these mappings determine which tactics are available to select. If MITRE no longer maps a technique to a tactic, that combination won't be available. For details about mappings that MITRE has removed, see [Review revoked MITRE tactic and technique associations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/security-management/threat-intelligence-security-center/tisc-review-revoked-mitre-associations.md).
