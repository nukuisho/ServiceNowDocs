Review details on the scan suites available on your instance.

Scan suites are collections of security center checks that execute together. You can use base system suites or create your own by cloning an existing suite and updating the checks made in the clone. For details, see [Create a scan suite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/security-center/create-new-suite.md).

Select the **+Create task** button to create a Security Task related to a scan suite. For details on Security Tasks, see [Security Tasks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/security-center/security-task-manager.md).
