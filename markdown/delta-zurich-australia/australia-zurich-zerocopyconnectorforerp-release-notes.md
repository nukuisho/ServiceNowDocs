-   **[Some Now Assist skills are turned on by default](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-skills-on-by-default&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The new default behavior works as follows:

    -   New customers: When you install a Now Assist product, designated skills are turned on automatically.
    -   Existing customers who are upgrading \(starting with Zurich Patch 4\): Any previously unconfigured skill is turned on automatically \(the skill was never configured and turned on, then turned off again\). Previously configured skills that were turned on, then off, remain inactive.

Determine if production and non-production instances are using the same or different versions of a model to check if the latest model updates are on your production instance.
