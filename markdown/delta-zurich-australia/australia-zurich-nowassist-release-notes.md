## Important information for upgrading Now Assist to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

Customers who have not opted into third-party, large language models may be routed to them during skill execution. If the new model is not provisioned or available in your environment, this will result in skill execution failures. Check the models your skills use within Now Assist admin console.

 If you customized UI actions or other items that are associated with Now Assist skills, confirm that your customized code is updated with the new skill releases. Otherwise, certain functions might not work as expected.

 If you run into issues when you're upgrading a Now Assist product, see the [Issues and mitigation for Now Assist \(Generative AI\) Applications and Plugin updates \[KB1637452\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1637452) article in the Now Support Knowledge Base. Log in to view the article.

 The Zurich release introduces enhanced protections for read‑only fields across the ServiceNow® AI Platform. These changes include a new “read\_only\_option” field with granular control levels, including “strict\_read\_only” and “client\_script\_modifiable". The changes occur in the back-end and maintain backward‑compatible behavior. This update helps strengthen your instance security while preserving the flexibility you need. If you have custom client scripts that modify ServiceNow® ‑owned read‑only fields using `g_form.setValue()` or `g_form.clearValue()`, refer to [KB2718122](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2718122). This article provides additional technical details on how to identify affected fields and adjust their settings.

 The existing Access Control Lists \(ACLs\) will be updated to replace the 'admin' role with specific, purpose-driven granular roles within scripts or security attributes. As part of this update, the `getRoles()` API will be replaced with the `hasRole()` API for authorization purposes. Additionally, all references to the 'admin' role in the code will be substituted with the new feature-specific granular roles for authorization use cases. Read [https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/platform-security/granular-admin-roles.html](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/platform-security/granular-admin-roles.html) to learn more.

Once enabled, Voice Input can be changed using the individual user accessibility preferences. See [Configure accessibility preferences](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=next-experience-accessibility-preferences&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US) for more information.
