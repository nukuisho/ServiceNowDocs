Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Configuring Notify in Service Operations Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-notify-sow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure Notify with Microsoft Teams SOW in Admin Center using the guided setup.

-   **[Visual indicators for unread messages](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sow-itsm-workspace-chat-session-tabs-configure&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

To help agents maintain the Service Level Agreement \(SLA\) for chats, visual indicators are available on chat session tabs in the SOW. These indicators include color codes, where tabs with unread messages are highlighted in different colors. Inactive tabs display a purple background color to indicate that a message has been received. Tab colors shift to yellow and then to red to highlight critical wait times. These enhancements aim to improve customer service by ensuring quick response time, increase productivity by helping agents manage multiple chats more effectively, and reduce stress by providing clear visual cues, ultimately leading to better SLA compliance and higher service quality.

-   **[Resize modal in Service Operations Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-update-inc-overview-tab&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Optimize your viewing experience by resizing the following modals in SOW:

    -   Copy incident
    -   Report knowledge gap
    -   Reopen incident
-   **[Add similar incidents to major incident record](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=managing-major-incident-sow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Find multiple similar incidents and add them as child incidents to a major incident or major incident candidate record from the child incident related list in the **Related records** tab of the major incident record. Similar incidents are retrieved based on the similarity solution definition that can be configured to train on various fields such as **Short description** and **Description**. Adding the similar incidents as child incidents to the major incident record ensures avoiding the creation of multiple major incident records for the same issue.

-   **[On-Call Scheduling enhancements in Service Operations Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=work-on-escalation-trigger-rules-and-policies-in-sow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

On-call scheduling in SOW has the following enhancements:

    -   The On-call trigger rule page is enhanced to support and select subflows.
    -   The On-call trigger rule page is enhanced for supporting re-triggering escalations on configured fields such as Priority. Re-triggering is enabled whenever the value in the configured field changes.
    -   Configure custom providers as channels for on-call escalation notifications.
    -   Send the on-call escalations notifications to all stakeholders when any of the record fields configured using the on-call trigger rules are modified.
-   **[Auto-dismiss the alerts and notification in Service Operations Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-alerts-auto-dismiss-sow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure the alerts and notifications in SOW to automatically dismiss within the specified time. Auto-dismissal of the alert notification reduces the user effort in manually dismissing the notification. By default, the base system has the following settings:

    -   Auto-dismiss is turned on for alert notification of type info, positive \(success\) and low and has the timeout value of three seconds.
    -   Auto-dismiss is turned off for alert notification of type critical, high, moderate, and warning.
    -   The time label is turned off and only a visual time indicator is displayed.
    -   The alert notification content is expanded.
-   **[DEX and SO view in the investigate tab](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dex-so-metric-views-investigate-tab&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Based on the Configuration Item \(CI\) selected in the **Investigate** tab and the rules defined in the **Investigate CI Experience Rules** \(**sn\_sow\_investigate\_ci\_ux\_rule**\) table, the Investigate tab displays the CI metrics in the UI experience dashboard view for the different CI classes:

    -   DEX view - Displayed for the cmdb\_ci\_computer CI class.
    -   SO view - Displayed for the cmdb\_ci\_service class.
You can select both the affected CIs including service and service offering and caller CIs.

-   **[SOW record page enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-update-inc-overview-tab&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The SOW record page has the following enhancements:

    -   Add a clickable URL to the Summary section on the **Overview** tab of an incident record, enhancing navigation and reference capabilities. The Overview page supports URL type of field in read-only mode.
    -   Perform various DEX actions on a CI using actions from the Action library in the contextual side panel of the SOW record page.
    -   Manage user actions on the reference fields of a SOW record page with the following glide list actions:
        -   Add me - Add the logged in user to the field.
        -   Remove me - Remove the logged in user from the field.
        -   Add multiple users - Add multiple users to the field.
        -   Add multiple records - Add multiple records to the field.
-   **[View recent tasks in a knowledge article record](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=work-knowledge-article&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure the **Display recent task for knowledge article** \(**glide.knowman.recent\_task.display**\) system property to view the recent task records to which the knowledge article is recently attached. You can select the task record link to open the task record in a new tab with the workspace view.

-   **[Introduction of Granular Admin roles in SOW](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=roles-in-sow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following granular admin roles are introduced in SOW:

    -   sn\_sow\_admin.sn\_sow\_admin: Provides access to SOW Admin Center page for SOW configurations. Admins can use the role to configure SOW features and maintain organizational policies.
    -   sn\_sow\_inc\_sn\_incident\_sow\_admin: Provides access to SOW Admin Center pages for configurations related to Incident Management features.
    -   sn\_sow\_mim.sn\_mim\_sow\_admin: Provides access to the SOW Admin Center pages for configurations related to Major Incident Management \(MIM\) features.
    -   sn\_sow\_on\_call.sn\_on\_call\_sow\_admin: Provides access to the SOW Admin Center pages for On-Call Scheduling configurations.
    -   sn\_sow\_problem.sn\_problem\_sow\_admin: Provides access to the SOW Admin Center pages for Problem Management configurations.
-   **[View conflicts in the change request form](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-change-sow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The improved schedule and conflicts section added in the change request form displays the scheduling conflicts for a change request. If a scheduling conflict exists, conflict detection also provides details of any related blackout or maintenance schedules and other active change requests to determine the scheduling conflict. You can use the resulting information to review and modify the change request details to eliminate conflicts. You can also manually check and manage conflicts.

For more information on conflict detection, see [Conflict detection](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=c_ConflictDetection&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Interaction wrap up with modeless dialog](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=interaction-wrap-up-sow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Provide agents with dedicated time after each call or chat to finalize the interaction details and wrap up their work before starting a new conversation.

-   **[UI16 links to SOW redirection behavior](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-admin-console-sow-itsm&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Improve the fulfiller experience by redirecting UI16 module links such as forms and lists to the equivalent SOW experience. The UI16 module link redirection behavior is supported for all the applications in SOW when the system property **sn\_sow\_itsm\_admin.experience\_redirection\_enabled.sow** is set to `true`.

For new instances, this redirection configuration is automatically available in the base system. For upgrade instances, administrators can configure the redirection behavior from the SOW Admin Center. You can enable this feature for the UI16 links and user groups or specifically for a custom table. You can also enable this feature for specific user groups or all user groups within the custom table or applications in SOW.

-   **[Mapping granular admin roles with SOW granular roles](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=roles-in-sow&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Using granular admin roles, provide full administrative access to the configuration and property pages for the applications in SOW without requiring the administrator \(admin\) role. These granular admin roles are mapped with ACLs and contain the corresponding existing SOW granular roles.

-   **[UX property to hide contextual side panel](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-admin-console-sow-itsm&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Hide contextual side panel for specific table and tab combination option from the SOW Properties section in the SOW Admin Center to configure the hide **ContextualSidebar** UX page property. This property enables you to define the table with tab combination for which the default primary contextual side panel must be hidden, prioritizing the embedded contextual side panel within the tab instead.

-   **[Review AI incident summary and suggestions in the incident record](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-update-inc-overview-tab&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Investigate and resolve incidents efficiently by reviewing the AI-generated incident summary and suggested resolution plan in the AI summary and suggestions card on the **Overview** tab of an incident record. If the **Overview** tab is hidden for L1 service desk agents, the card appears on the **Details** tab.

    -   The related lists in the **Related records** tab of the SOW record pages, including the Multi Record Associator \(MRA\) list, as well as the related lists within the record pages such as Recent Incidents or Assigned Assets, now support the fuzzy count UX page property.

-   **Reflow**

The Configurable Workspace supports reflow, which enables pages and content to be zoomed up to 400% through your browser settings without loss of content or functionality. Additionally, content can be enlarged without scrolling in two dimensions at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels or a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels. Page layouts are transformed into a vertical, stacked view automatically when users increase browser zoom to 400%.

This enhancement helps users with low vision or who have trouble seeing web content in a browser due to monitor size, device type, poor lighting, or other situations. Reflow can be turned off with a system property for instances, experiences, and pages. See [\[Placeholder link text to key bundle-platux.auto-reflow\]](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=auto-reflow&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US) for details.
