-   **[Support for MID Server cluster](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=playbook-enter-github-instance-details&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Improve load balancing and failover protection by selecting a MID Server cluster when connecting to a tool instance associated with a MID Server cluster. This configuration enables multiple MID Servers with relevant capabilities to be grouped.

-   **[Improved UX for DevOps Change health scans](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=run-health-scan-check&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Run health scans and analyze findings efficiently in the DevOps Change workspace with an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

-   **[Pipeline association for GitHub Actions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sc-github&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

When onboarding GitHub Actions pipelines through the App onboarding catalog or the onboarding APIs, now only the selected pipelines are associated with the DevOps app. If no pipeline is selected, all pipelines within the specified repository are associated.

-   **[Tool connection check status](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=devops-reference-error-messages&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

If a tool is marked as Disconnected because of a system-generated failure during an unsuccessful connection check, any subsequent successful check automatically updates the connection status to Connected. If you manually disconnect the tool, the tool status remains Disconnected even if there’s a subsequent successful connection check.

-   **[New roles for vulnerability integration](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=installed-with-dev-ops&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   The sn\_vul.app\_sec\_manager role is added to the DevOps Tool Owner \[sn\_devops.tool\_owner\] role when the DevOps Vulnerability Integrations plugin \(sn\_devops\_vul\_ints\) is installed.
    -   The sn\_vul\_veracode.configure\_integration role is added to the DevOps Tool Owner \[sn\_devops.tool\_owner\] role when the Vulnerability Response Integration with Veracode plugin \(sn\_vul\_veracode\) is installed.

Update the **sn\_devops.commit\_rel\_change\_step\_type** property to have other step types, like Test or Deploy, use the same commit logic as Prod Deploy.

-   **[Override start and end time of a change request](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dev-ops-config-change-details&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Set the  **sn\_devops.change\_request.auto\_close\_allow\_override\_start\_time ** and  **sn\_devops.change\_request.auto\_close\_allow\_override\_end\_time ** properties as false to consider the change request start and end time instead of the pipeline’s when the  autoCloseChange  parameter is enabled in a pipeline.

-   **[Node version of DevOps extension](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=config-dev-ops-extensions-azure&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**
