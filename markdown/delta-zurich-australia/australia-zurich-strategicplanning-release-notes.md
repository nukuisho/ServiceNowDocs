# Combined Strategic Planning release notes for upgrades from Zurich to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Strategic Planning from Zurich to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Strategic Planning release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Zurich to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Strategic Planning to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

After upgrading to Strategic Planning v4.8.0, the existing **Investment type** and **Investment class** fields will appear as **Investment type \(Deprecated\)** and **Investment class \(Deprecated\)** respectively across the Planning page including in the Prioritization and Roadmap views and in the Scenario Planning page. The values from these deprecated fields will be automatically copied to the new **Investment type** and **Investment class** fields.

 If you previously applied filters or personalized your view using the deprecated fields, you must update those configurations to use the new **Investment type** and **Investment class** fields across the workspace—including in the Prioritization and Roadmap views on the Planning page, as well as in the Scenario Planning page.

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Strategic Planning and AI Control Tower](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=better-together-with-other-apps-spw&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Categorize your strategic priorities, goals, planning items, and execution items—projects and demands as Artificial Intelligence to track and monitor strategy progress from the AI Control Tower workspace.

Use the **Type** field for strategic priorities, the **Category** field for goals, the **Investment type** field for planning items - to classify them as Artificial Intelligence and monitor their progress in the AI Control Tower workspace.

-   **[Integrate Enterprise Agile Planning \(EAP\) with Atlassian Jira](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=spw-jira-landing&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Facilitate execution of the work planned in EAP and executed in Jira. With this integration, enable seamless tracking of work across tools with bidirectional sync between Jira and EAP. Key updates made in one system, such as a status change or field update for Epics and Stories, will automatically reflect in the other. This integration ensures your team can collaborate and track development efforts without switching contexts, reducing manual effort and improving visibility across platforms.

-   **[Enterprise Agile Planning \(EAP\) integration with CWM](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=agile-sprint-planning-in-cwm&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enhance visibility, planning, and execution for your teams with seamless integration between EAP and CWM.

For Agile teams managing non-agile work items such as incidents and change tasks, this integration bridges the gap by automatically creating a dedicated Space and Board in CWM. Agile work is seamlessly brought over via Connected Work, while EAP sprints are reflected directly in CWM’s Sprint planning view, thus enabling unified planning across work types. Teams can plan work for their sprints and update work status directly from the CWM Board, with performance reports in EAP dynamically reflecting these changes. This integration enables teams to manage their full scope of work from a single, connected workspace.

-   **[Dynamic data linking in Docs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=docs-for-planning-items-in-spw&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Keep record information in your documentation always current and reduce manual effort with the Dynamic data linking feature in Docs. You can now reference any ServiceNow application record and Docs will automatically reflect the latest updates from those records. For example, if you add a reference to a Project record, the reference will show the latest field information of the project in Docs without requiring manual edits. Clicking the project reference opens up the project form so that you can view the full details of the project record and make any necessary changes. Dynamic linking also enables adding references to a particular field of a record, such as Assigned to of an Incident record.

You can add references from any ServiceNow table you have access to, with no setup or configuration needed, thereby eliminate the hassle of switching between applications to copy and paste data from various records into Docs.

-   **[Epic status assessment](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=assess-epic-status-now-assist-eap&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Automatically evaluate epic health across six risk dimensions using the Epic status assessment skill in Enterprise Agile Planning. Now Assist analyzes story health, blocked stories, dependencies, progress, timeline, and ownership to return a red, yellow, or green status with plain-English reasoning. Portfolio managers can quickly assess epic risks without manually reviewing stories, timelines, and assignments by selecting the **Epic status** button on the epic record page.

-   **[AI-generated insights for portfolio plans](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-portfolio-insights&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Gain AI-generated insights for planning items within a portfolio plan using the Portfolio insights skill. Identify planning items that are delayed beyond their planned end date, have delayed starts, or have misalignments between planned and approved dates. Monitor active projects that show early risk indicators but have not yet experienced delays.View AI-generated top root causes and recommended actions for each insight category to help address delays and misalignments effectively.

Users with the sn\_align\_core.apw\_admin role assigned can configure severity thresholds and scoring factors for planning items to control how the Portfolio insights skill classifies insight severity as Critical, Medium, or Low.

-   **[Story generation for epics in Agile Development 2.0 and EAP](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=generate-stories-quickly-for-eap-and-agile-2-0&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Generate a complete user story, including title, description, and acceptance criteria, directly from an epic instead of creating one. By providing one or two lines of context, you can generate a story and edit inline before saving. This skill is available in both Agile Development 2.0 and EAP.

-   **[Next Experience for Demand Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=demand-workspace&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Next Experience for Demand Management delivers a unified experience for managing strategic and operational demands in Strategic Planning. This Next Experience interface consolidates demand creation, assessment, collaboration, and conversion in one place, eliminating context switching and reducing reliance on the classic Demand Workbench.

-   **[Create and manage demands in Next Experience for Demand Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-demands-dmnd-wpc&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Create and manage a demand in Next Experience for Demand Management using guided tabs that help you define alignment, estimate costs, and confirm readiness as you build out the demand.
    -   Collaborate on demands through Docs, with execution and planning synced.
    -   View, add, and edit cost plans and budgeting details using related lists.
-   **[Use Playbooks in Next Experience for Demand Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-playbooks-in-dw&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Help teams manage demands with greater structure and consistency using Playbook in Next Experience for Demand Management.

Playbooks enable you to define multiple governance processes across the organization using a low‑code/no‑code configuration experience. Create clear stages and guided activities from demand intake to completion by using a default playbook or creating a custom playbook to support your organization’s multiple demand management processes.

-   **[Associate AI systems with demands in Next Experience for Demand Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-playbooks-in-dw&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

-   **[Summarize demands using Now Assist for SPM](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=summarize-demand-in-demand-workspace&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Generate a concise, structured summary of any demand using the demand summarization skill through the **Summarize** button in the demand form. The skill reviews the demand fields and helps create a clear summary of the demand.

-   **[Strategy and Goals](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=strategy-goals-landing-page&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use boards in Strategy and Goals to organize and manage your organization’s strategic priorities and objectives. A board is a collection of strategic plans, priorities, objectives, and key results based on your selected filter criteria—helping you stay focused and manage them effectively.

    -   Managing boards:
        -   Create boards step by step, choosing whether to base them on strategic plans, priorities, goals, or both. Define what items to display using advanced filter conditions.
        -   Build boards tailored to specific goals by entity type and entity, ensuring focus on the goals that matter most.
        -   Share boards with stakeholders to align efforts and drive shared outcomes.
        -   Add boards to your favorites for faster navigation.
    -   Managing strategy and goals using boards:
        -   Create and organize strategic plans, strategic priorities, goals, and key results in a single, focused view.
        -   Associate work or planning items with goals or targets to align your current or future work with your strategic priorities, helping your team achieve goals and targets efficiently.
        -   As the goal or process owner, send notifications to target owners or contributors to ensure timely updates of target actuals.
        -   Target owners and contributors receive reminder notifications for check-in updates before the due date.
        -   With Now Assist for Strategic Portfolio Management \(SPM\), generate measurable targets for your goals to reduce the effort of defining clear success criteria, and gain actionable insights to identify at‑risk goals, assess forecasted status, and act on AI‑driven recommendations.
-   **[AI-generated insights for goals](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=generate-insights-for-goal&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Generate AI‑powered insights using the goal insights skill to gain predictive, actionable visibility into goal health. By analyzing the goal, goal targets, subgoals, and aligned work, the system delivers data‑driven insights that help goal owners and contributors manage risks proactively and improve goal outcomes. Insights include AI-forecasted status, confidence of achieving the goal, targets at risk, and aligned work or recommendations that have been delayed or stalled.
    -   View the AI-forecasted status for goals and targets in the grid, generated automatically via the Goal insights generation scheduled job, along with the rationale for the generated status.
    -   Configure run frequency and set of goals to run the Goal insights generation scheduled job as need. The job is inactive by default.
-   **[Portfolio plan goals enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=managing-goals-in-alignment-planner-workspace&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Owners and contributors are notified when they’re mentioned in a goal, target, or when comments are added.
    -   Define targets across multiple organizational levels with the Assigned entity field in the target form. This enables targets created at higher levels \(for example, Company\) to be directly assigned to lower levels \(for example, Business Unit, Department\), eliminating redundant subgoal creation, and streamlining overall goal management.
-   **[Portfolio plan enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-portfolio-plans-in-alignment-planner-workspace&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Visualize planning items in lanes with the new Kanban tab in the Planning page and access the Hierarchy tab directly from the same location. These tabs replace the previous access point in the Prioritization tab, offering a more streamlined way to view and manage planning items.
    -   Save filter views specific to the Kanban tab and the Hierarchy tab without affecting views in the Prioritization tab.
    -   View planning items in the new Hierarchy tab on the Planning page, now sorted using global rank when available. Drag and drop is supported for lowest‑level items, enabling you to rerank them within their groups.
    -   Share a portfolio plan using the Copy link option. This provides access to existing users who have access to the portfolio plan.
    -   Make a portfolio plan public and share the copied link with Strategic Planning Workspace users, without inviting them individually or as a group. Note that users accessing a public portfolio plan with the shared link cannot view scenarios within the plan.
    -   Expand or collapse portfolio plan header to maximize screen space while planning.
    -   Edit the default view within a portfolio plan and save changes using the Save view option.
    -   View additional status attributes — cost, resource, schedule, and scope — for planning items in Strategic Planning Workspace. For project planning items, these attributes are synced automatically from the latest published project status report. For other planning items, these attributes can be set manually. Note that project status report attributes synced from the Project status \(project\_status\) table are read-only in Strategic Planning Workspace and can't be edited directly.
    -   Set planning item status to **No status** when a status has not been determined, in addition to the existing **Green**, **Yellow**, and **Red** values, giving planners the flexibility to update the status as needed. By default, the status is set **No status** when a planning item is created.
    -   Display rollup bars at parent levels in the hierarchy view and choose the date type to display — approved, planned, or actual. Use the comparison option to compare date types, such as approved versus planned dates, to identify schedule misalignments.
-   **[Plan efficiently with additional pre-defined lenses](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=lens-alignment-planner-workspace&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Planning item lens to plan, prioritize, and roadmap work in Strategic Planning Workspace directly with planning items, without configuring organization structure, programs, portfolios, or products. The lens supports all enabled work item types, such as projects and demands, and can be used as a standalone lens or alongside other lenses.

-   **[Hierarchy tab for EAP teams](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=eap-hierarchy-tab&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Gain visibility into how your work connects to broader organizational goals by viewing the complete work item hierarchy directly in the EAP workspace. Expand any epic to see its capabilities, features, and stories across Solution Trains, ARTs, and Agile Teams without switching between multiple screens or running separate reports.

Customize your view by selecting which columns appear in the hierarchy grid and adjusting column widths to match your workflow. Your column preferences persist across sessions, so your configured view is ready each time you return.

The Hierarchy tab requires your admin to enable it through the **sn\_apw\_advanced.enable\_hierarchy\_view** system property. See [Enable Hierarchy tab in EAP](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hierarchy-enable-eap&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[Open EAP work items in new browser tab](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-eap&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Open work items from the EAP Backlog and Hierarchy pages in a new browser tab, so you never lose your context. Right-click any work item, or use the item options menu, to open its full details in a separate tab. This feature lets you review and compare multiple work items side by side without losing your current view.

-   **[Move work items to the top or bottom in EAP Backlog](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=schedule-work-items-into-iterations-in-eap-backlog&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Promote an urgent story to the top of a sprint or push deprioritized work to the bottom of a long backlog without dragging items across multiple pages. Right-click any story, feature, capability, or epic in the EAP Backlog, iteration, or team grid and select **Move to top** or **Move to bottom** to re-prioritize the work item in one action. Prioritization changes take effect across all pages, so you can act on shifting priorities even when the work item is far from its target position.

-   **[Live updates in the EAP Hierarchy tab](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=eap-hierarchy-tab&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Keep working in your hierarchy without breaking your flow each time you create a work item. When you create a work item with the Hierarchy tab open, it is added to your current view immediately, so you don't need to refresh the page to see a new story, feature, capability, or epic. A new top-level item appears alongside the existing top-level items for the selected portfolio configuration. A new child item appears under its parent when that parent is expanded.

-   **[Active work first in the EAP Backlog](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-eap&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Plan and prioritize without sifting through completed or cancelled work. The Backlog section of the EAP Backlog tab now hides completed and cancelled work items by default, so the list shows only what your teams have to work on. Sprint and Planning Interval \(PI\) sections continue to show all work items, giving you visibility into both ongoing and finished work for each iteration.

Admins can change these settings for either sections using two new system properties: `sn_apw_advanced.show_inactive_items_in_backlog_list` for the Backlog section and `sn_apw_advanced.show_inactive_items_in_iteration` for iteration sections.

-   **[Admin role enhancements in Feedback](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=components-installed-with-product-feedback&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The read role sn\_align\_core.pf\_read and write role sn\_align\_core.apw\_admin are added to the following system properties in Feedback and Product idea:

    -   sn\_apw\_advanced.product\_feedback\_allowed\_non\_planning\_items\_for\_link\_item
    -   sn\_apw\_advanced.product\_feedback\_product\_idea\_filters
    -   sn\_apw\_advanced.product\_feedback\_feedback\_filters
    -   sn\_apw\_advanced.feedback.idea\_feedback\_queue\_address
-   **[Financials for planning items](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-financials-spw&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Migration of financial baselines:
        -   Migrate the financial baselines of projects, which includes investment currency support.
        -   While migration, financial baselines will now include actuals, costs, benefits, and budget values from the project currency to the investment currency.
    -   Streamlined currency fields while using multicurrency:
        -   New and existing customers will now see only investment currency fields in demand and project records.
        -   Planned costs, actual costs, planned benefits, actual benefits, and budget fields are included in the financial baselines.
