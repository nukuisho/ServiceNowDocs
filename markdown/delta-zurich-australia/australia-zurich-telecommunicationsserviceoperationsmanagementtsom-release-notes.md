-   **[Telecom Discovery Builder framework](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=exploring-the-telco-generic-schema-etl-framework&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Leverage a standardized Extract, Transform, Load \(ETL\) framework to streamline the processing and storage of telecom network data on the ServiceNow AI Platform.

This reusable framework simplifies implementation by removing the need to manually build ETLs. It enables you to focus on connectivity logic while confirming consistent and reliable mapping of network elements such as equipment, cards, ports, LAGs, logical ports, and logical connections into predefined CMDB structures.

Use Telecom Discovery Builder Framework to do the following:

    -   Simplify data transformation tasks by duplicating the common ETL and configuring essential fields and settings for specific connector applications.
    -   Deploy new Service Graph Connector \(SGC\) using existing ETLs to maintain consistent data transformation practices.
    -   Help to ensure data integrity and support the automatic creation of TNI Entities through configured Before and After scripts.
    -   The standardized CMDB/TNI data model enables ETL reusability across multiple connectors.
    -   Allocate predefined storage locations for both physical and logical inventory elements.
    -   Maintain consistent data model hierarchies across connectors to support unified network inventory management.
    -   Improve Discovery SGC quality by providing an OOTB Data Source Validation tools.
-   **[Identify and reconcile discrepancies](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=exploring-telecom-reconciliation&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use enhanced discrepancy identification and reconciliation features to keep your discovery data accurate and up to date on the ServiceNow AI Platform. These features give you better control over detected changes and improve overall audit performance.

    -   Identify attribute value mismatches during discovery, such as bandwidth changes on ports \(for example, from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps\).
    -   Display previous and current attribute values, enabling you to decide whether to accept the new value, retain the old one, or manually raise a remediation task.
    -   Detect discrepancies in logical entities alongside physical entities for comprehensive discrepancy management for newly discovered logical network elements.
    -   Generate audit results using filtering conditions—such as specific IP ranges, device vendors, or port types—to focus on relevant subsets of data and significantly enhance audit performance and usability.
-   **[Fault Management: Events and alerts](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=fault-management-events-and-alerts&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

You can monitor your SD-WAN network health and resolve issues faster with automated alerts and event detection.

    -   Detect and resolve SD-WAN network issues faster with automated alerts and event monitoring.
    -   Configure customizable event rules to detect SD-WAN device issues in real time.

-   **[Added Service Graph Connector for Cisco Meraki and Fortinet](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configuring-cisco-meraki-service-graph-connector&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The following capabilities have been added to Cisco Meraki and Fortinet:

    -   Provides a centralized management of physical infrastructure and logical network relationships within the ServiceNow AI Platform®.
    -   Supports automated, telecom-aware discovery and real-time CMDB synchronization, along with visual network mapping, guided setup, and a dashboard for monitoring integration health.
-   **[Granular admin roles](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=exploring-the-telco-generic-schema-etl-framework&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The granular admin role enables developers and administrators to complete administrative configuration tasks for TSOM without requiring the full admin role.

-   **[Telecom Discovery via Nokia Altiplano](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=service-graph-connector-for-nokia-altiplano&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Nokia Altiplano SGC enables you to do the following:

    -   Discover logical inventory for Nokia Altiplano such as logical ports, LAGs, and logical connections.
    -   Enable customers to manage both physical infrastructure and logical network relationships on the ServiceNow AI Platform.
    -   Store logical elements in the CMDB, improving visibility and traceability across the network.
    -   Use the generic Extract, Transform, Load \(ETL\) framework provided by ServiceNow to integrate with Nokia Altiplano, significantly reducing development effort.
-   **[Discrepancy identification](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=discrepancy-identification-types-of-discrepancies&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the enhanced audit and reconciliation logic to do the following:

    -   Detect mismatches in logical elements such as logical ports, LAGs, and connections.
    -   Filter audit results by IP range, device type, or vendor to focus on relevant subsets of data.
    -   Enhance audit performance, usability, and customer satisfaction by reducing unnecessary processing.

-   **SD-WAN Discovery connectors [SD-WAN data model](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sd-wan-data-model&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable comprehensive SD-WAN visibility by using new Telecom Discovery connectors. Standardize data processing through the SD-WAN Data Model integrated into the Telecom Discovery Builder Framework ETL pipeline.


-   **[Types of discrepancies](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=discrepancy-identification-types-of-discrepancies&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enhance discovery accuracy and data quality with SD-WAN-specific discrepancy audits that validate discovery results against the CMDB. Reconcile discrepancies manually or automatically using the remediation engine. When the audit detects a newly discovered CI not present in the CMDB, a single follow-on task is created at the equipment level for resolution.
