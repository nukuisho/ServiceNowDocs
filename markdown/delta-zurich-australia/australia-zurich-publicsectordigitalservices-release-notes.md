-   **[Grants Management Funding Program](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=psds-using-grants-management-playbook&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Create a funding program, which serves as the top-level container from which individual grant programs are created and derive their budget allocations.

Grant program managers can create a new funding program, or start by copying data and configurations from an existing funding program, using the funding program ID. From this funding program, admins can create grant programs directly, set and update the duration and overall budget, and ensure budgets flow down logically to individual grants.

Each grant program is associated with a single funding program via the funding program ID. All grant programs linked to a specific funding program share the cumulative budget of that funding program, and their start and end dates fall within the funding program's duration.

-   **[Grants Management Evaluation &amp; Decision​](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=psds-using-grants-management-playbook&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Simplify and streamline your grant application decisions​ with Grants Management:​ Evaluation &amp; Decision. You can review, score, and manage proposals for grant programs in the Merit Review portal and define a funding proposal for a grant program by using the Grants Workspace. You can share this information internally with the grant program director.​ Grant program managers can define the merit review framework criteria, assign a reviewer group to each application, create, and track merit review tasks. Grant program managers can use document templates to compose letters that inform the applicants of results, with template options for Award, Rejected \(Ineligible\), and Rejected \(Decline\).

-   **[Grants Management Reviewer Service portal](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=psds-gmp-using-merit-review-portal-agent&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable your merit reviewers to track, score, and monitor grant applications via a dedicated Reviewer Service portal. The merit reviewers can capture and aggregate scores across the Grant Proposal review framework​ in the Grants Workspace. A score and rationale can be summarized as part of the application proposal result.​

-   **[Agentic AI](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=agentic-ai-psds-explore&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Define the fees for information requests and autonomously assess waivers against an agency's criteria​. You can automate the process of synthesizing similar information requests and associated fees, and apply those fees to cases​. Your case fields are automatically filled in and integrated into the Information Request Playbook workflow and ServiceNow's AI framework.

-   **[Enhancements to the grants management Workspace- Rolling grant approvals](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=psds-using-grants-management-playbook&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Propose awards and declines for any scored subset of applications at any time. The Rolling grant approval feature enhances the Grants management funding workflow, by giving Grant Program Managers the flexibility to propose awards and declines for any scored subset of applications at any time, without waiting for the entire proposal portfolio to complete review. From this release, Grant Program Managers can choose to process funding decisions incrementally as proposals are scored, or continue working in the traditional full-portfolio model.

The feature introduces the Funding Allocation Request as a new record type — an approval packet that groups a subset of proposals for Grant Program Director review. The Grant Program Director can either approve the Funding Allocation Request or reject it, returning all proposals in the batch, regardless of whether they were on the funding or decline track. The proposals in the rejected batch feed back into the Grant Program Manager's working queue, re-entering the funding pool for future review and funding allocation opportunities. The Funding Allocation Requests introduce an alternative to the previous all-or-none approval model and enable continuous, long-running grant programs to operate on a single program record.

Release result letters per proposal for Rolling grant approval scenarios in Grants Management. Once a proposal’s funding or decline decision is approved through its Funding Allocation Request \(FAR\), the corresponding award, decline, or ineligibility letter can be issued to that applicant independently—without waiting for program-wide completion.

-   **[Investigative Case Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=psds-explore-inv-case-management&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Create an investigative case using Investigative Case Management. Investigative Case Management guides investigators through the process of organizing, tracking, and resolving investigations, ​developing case details,​ assigning investigators and team members​, and track evidence with logging and metadata. The following features are available as part of Investigative Case Management:

    -   Entity Management
    -   Evidence Management
With Entity Management, investigators can create investigative tasks and workflows for investigative activities with automated metadata capture \(time, source, entities, classification\)​, as well as define processing with teams and attorneys and collaborate across agencies/divisions. With Evidence Management, investigators can log and triage evidence metadata \(digital, physical, testimonial\)​ and maintain an audit trail \(Chain of Custody logging\), as well as draft, review, and create reports with supporting evidence​​.

-   **[Use Now Assist for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\) Skills to create case narratives and screen documents](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-psds-using&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Complete case narratives and make refinements to investigative case records using Now Assist for PSDS Gen-AI skills. Investigators can streamline case narrative refinement by editing content, adjusting tone, and regenerating the narrative for clarity and completeness.

-   **[Use the Case Narrative Refinement AI Agent to refine case narratives in Investigative Case Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=psds-na-case-narrative-refinement-agent&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Produce clear, accurate, and well-structured case narratives using the Case narrative refinement AI agent, embedded within the case record page. This AI agent analyzes existing narratives and related case data to suggest improvements in clarity, structure, tone, and completeness, and highlighting gaps and inconsistencies.

-   **[Document Screening AI Skill for Social Benefits Playbook](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=psds-ai-skill-doc-screening&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Validate large volumes of uploaded documents, verify information, flag issues, and highlight key details for case agents using the Social Benefits Playbook with the Document Screening Al Skill, part of Now Assist for Public Sector Digital Services \(PSDS\).

-   **[Granular configuration admin roles](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=roles-installed-with-public-sector-digital-services&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Several new granular admin roles enable admins to complete administrative configuration tasks on the Public Sector Digital Services platform without requiring the full admin role. These granular access roles enable a high-level administrator to define and assign custom roles that contain only the specific permissions a user needs, decreasing the number of users with full administrative power over the instance. For more information on granular admin roles, see [Granular admin roles](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=granular-admin-roles&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).
