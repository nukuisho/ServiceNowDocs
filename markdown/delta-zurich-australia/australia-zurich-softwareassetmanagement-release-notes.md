# Combined Software Asset Management release notes for upgrades from Zurich to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for Software Asset Management from Zurich to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family Software Asset Management release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Zurich to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

## Important information for upgrading Software Asset Management to Australia

Before you upgrade to Australia, review these pre- and post-upgrade tasks and complete the tasks as needed.

<table class="custom-rows"><thead><tr><th class="filter">

Release notes

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

Starting from the Zurich release, the following workflows are migrated to Flow Designer as flows:

-   Reclamation workflow
-   Procurement Process Flow - Auto allocation enabled

When upgrading to the Zurich release, a fix script identifies whether the workflows were customized. If you haven't customized the workflows before the upgrade, the fix script deactivates the legacy workflows from the instance and deploys the Flow Designer flows on the instance post-upgrade. If you have customized the impacted workflows in the previous release, the fix script doesn’t deploy the Flow Designer flows on the instance post-upgrade. You can view and access the impacted workflows in the instance after the upgrade. However, the deprecated workflows are considered as custom code and ServiceNow doesn’t support those workflows.

 Starting from the Zurich release, the Software Asset Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\) is moved from the family release to the Software Asset Workspace store application. After upgrading to Zurich, the Software Asset Workspace plugin \(com.sn\_sam\_workspace\) is inactivated and the Software Asset Workspace store application \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) is enabled in the instance.

 When upgrading to the Software Asset Management – SaaS License Management plugin \(sn\_sam\_saas\_int\) version 16.0.6 or later in the Zurich release, verify that the Software Asset Workspace store app \(sn\_sam\_workspace\) is updated to version 9.0.4.
