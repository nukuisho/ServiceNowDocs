-   **[Admin role dependency](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=granular-admin-roles&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Several new granular admin roles enable developers to complete administrative configuration tasks without requiring the full admin role.

    -   Users who aren't assigned an OT role cannot view OT records in the following CMDB tables:
        -   IP Address \[cmdb\_ci\_ip\_address\]
        -   Network Adapter \[cmdb\_ci\_network\_adapter\]
        -   Serial Number \[cmdb\_serial\_number\]
