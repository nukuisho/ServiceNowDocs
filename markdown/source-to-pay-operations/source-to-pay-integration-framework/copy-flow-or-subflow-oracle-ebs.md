5.  Activate the flow or subflow.

    -   Make sure that the flow or subflow is available and activated on the base system.

6.  Use the **Trigger Condition** for the flow or subflow.

    This flow or subflow is triggered and associated with the purchase order when the following conditions are met:

    -   **Legal entity . ERP source . Active** is **true**.

    **Note:** Once data is pulled into staging tables, transform maps move data into target tables.
