# Look up primary data in Oracle Financial Cloud

You can run a job to look up primary data \(for example, Currencies\) from different ERP sources into ServiceNow.

Before you start the ERP integration, you must configure the integration services record for the target ERP source using the `sn_fcms_intg_service` table. The `sn_fcms_intg_service` table is a mapping table between sub flows and target ERP source. For more information on creating an integration service record, see [Create Integration Service record](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/source-to-pay-integration-framework/create-integration-service-record.md).
