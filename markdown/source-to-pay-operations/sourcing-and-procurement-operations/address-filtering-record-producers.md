# Delivery address filtering in record producers

Off-catalog record producer forms include address fields that enable shoppers to specify delivery locations. Removed delivery addresses do not appear in these fields, consistent with Shopping Hub checkout behavior.

## Affected record producers

Address filtering applies to all record producers in the Spend catalog that include delivery address fields:

-   Contract renewal for good
-   Contract renewal for service
-   I need a product
-   I need a service
-   I need to submit a quote

## Address filtering behavior

Address filtering in record producers uses the same pattern as Shopping Hub checkout:

-   All address field queries include a `deleted=false` filter
-   In the delivery address table, the Deleted column is set to **true** when a delivery address is removed and **false** when it is available
-   The filter excludes removed addresses from address field results
-   Available delivery addresses appear for selection as normal

## Shopper experience

-   When filling out a record producer form, only available delivery addresses appear for selection.
-   Shoppers can still browse the full organizational address directory when adding a new work address.
-   If a user re-adds a previously removed address from the work directory, the address reappears as an available option in record producer forms.
-   The same delivery addresses that are unavailable at checkout are unavailable in record producers, providing a consistent experience.
