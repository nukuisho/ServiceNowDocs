# Summarize a procurement record in Source-to-Pay Workspace

Get a quick overview of a procurement record's status, completed actions, and next steps, without reading through all the details. ServiceNow Otto for SPO generates a focused summary in seconds.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_spend\_gen\_ai.now\_assist\_fulfiller

## About this task

The summary appears in different places depending on which interface you're using:

-   Core UI: The summary appears in a banner at the top of the record.
-   Source-to-Pay Workspace: The summary appears in the **Details** tab.

-   **What the summary includes**

    Based on the type of procurement record, ServiceNow Otto for SPO generates a summary with the following sections:

    -   **Overview**: Information about the record.
    -   **Actions completed**: Actions that have been taken so far.
    -   **Next steps**: Actions you need to do next for open cases. For purchase requisitions and procurement cases, if the record has associated email records, this also factors in the sender, date, and key message from those emails \(excluding standard state-change notifications\).
    -   **Close notes**: Complete resolution summary for closed procurement cases.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Source-to-Pay Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(\[Omitted image "cases-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon.\).
