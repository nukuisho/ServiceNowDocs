# Create Sourcing Request or Purchase Requisition in SPO via Asset Management Workspace

As an Asset Manager, you can create an SR or PR in SPO from the Asset Management Workspace to fulfill asset requests submitted through Employee Center.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_spend\_asset.spo\_shopper

## About this task

After an employee submits a request through the Employee Center or an automated stock rule is triggered, the Asset Manager can view the request in the Service Catalog application and start sourcing and procuring the requested items from the appropriate Asset Management Workspace.

The Asset Management workspace used depends on the type of items being requested, such as hardware, software, or enterprise assets.

-   Asset Workspace
-   Hardware Asset Workspace
-   Software Asset Workspace
-   Enterprise Asset Workspace

To ensure a seamless integration between Asset Management and SPO, the following updates have been implemented:

-   SPO's Purchase Requisition \(PR\), Sourcing Request \(SR\), and Purchase Order \(PO\) tables are mapped to their corresponding tables in Asset Management to enable smooth data flow between the two products.
-   When a PR, SR, or PO is created in SPO, the associated data and states are synchronized with the corresponding PO in Asset Management.
-   The Asset Management Purchase Order \(PO\), generated during the creation of a sourcing request or purchase requisition, provides visibility to both the employee and the asset manager.
-   Asset Management Purchase Order Lines \(POLs\) are generated after a supplier has been awarded in the sourcing request flow.
-   The Asset Management PO includes references to SPO's SR, PR, and PO records.
-   The Asset Management POL includes references to SPO's purchase requisition line \(PRL\) or POL records.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Open Records** &gt; **Requests**.

2.  Open the request.

    **Note:** The purchase quantity you specify should not exceed the quantity specified on the original request in the Service Catalog application. In the **Purchase quantity** field, if you specify a quantity that exceeds the original quantity, you see a message that informs you that the total quantity selected exceeds the quantity to be sourced.

10. Select **Request items and checkout**.

    One of the following occurs depending on whether the requested items have a price associated with them.

    -   For products that do not have an associated price, the sourcing flow is triggered.
