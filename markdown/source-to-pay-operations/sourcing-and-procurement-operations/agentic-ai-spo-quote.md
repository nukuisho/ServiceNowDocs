# Submit a purchase request by uploading a quote

Use the ServiceNow Otto chat interface in the Employee Center to describe your needs, upload a quote, and submit a purchase request.

3.  In the chat interface, enter details about the product to purchase.

    ServiceNow Otto displays product recommendations through the Procurement request path recommendation.

4.  Select **Yes** to upload a quote.

    **Note:** If your quote contains more than 50 products, set the **glide.sc.multirow\_set.rows.size** system property to a value greater than the total number of products in the quote. If the **glide.sc.multirow\_set.rows.size** system property does not exist, add it and set the type to Integer.

    Enter additional details, such as the reason for purchase, expected delivery date, and service period.

    **Note:** The file must be in PDF, PNG, or JPEG format and must not exceed 1 MB.

6.  Verify the quote file name.

    ServiceNow Otto processes the quote and extracts the details for review.

7.  Select the link to open the extracted quote it in a new tab.

8.  Verify that all information was extracted correctly.

    Review the extracted product details, quantities, and pricing before submitting. AI-generated extractions may contain errors.

10. Close the tab and return to the Employee Center.

    Select **Yes** to confirm you have submitted the extracted quote.
