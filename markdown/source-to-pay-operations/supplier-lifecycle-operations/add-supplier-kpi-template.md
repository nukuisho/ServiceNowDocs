# Create KPIs by adding suppliers to a KPI template

Add suppliers to KPI templates to generate KPI records and collection tasks automatically.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_kpi.admin or sn\_slm.manager or sn\_slm.admin

## About this task

The **Supplier** related tab for a KPI template displays the following information:

-   Automatically displays suppliers that match a segmentation rule that is linked to this KPI template.
-   Displays suppliers that you add manually by selecting **Add**.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Supplier Lifecycle Operations** &gt; **Source-to-Pay Workspace**.

2.  Select the list icon \(\[Omitted image "cases-list-icon.png"\] Alt text: List icon.\) and navigate to **Lists** &gt; **Performance management** &gt; **KPI Templates**.

3.  In the Name column, select the link to the KPI template.

4.  Select the **Suppliers** tab and select **Add**.

    The Add supplier dialog box is displayed which shows the list of existing suppliers. You can select suppliers from this list to generate template-corresponding KPIS for the selected suppliers.

5.  Select **Add**.

    Template-corresponding KPIs are created for the added suppliers and the newly added supplier is shown in the **Suppliers** related tab for the KPI template. Also, corresponding KPI collection tasks are created for the suppliers.

    **Note:** The same result can be achieved by adding a template to a supplier record.
