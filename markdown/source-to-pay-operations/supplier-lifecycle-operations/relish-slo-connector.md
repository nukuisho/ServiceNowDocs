# Relish Integration for Supplier Lifecycle Operations

The SLO Connector for Relish Data Assure plugin \(x\_reliq\_slo\_connec\) provides an integration between Relish and the Supplier Case Management plugin.

**Important:** Check your entitlements to determine whether you have access to Relish Integration for Supplier Lifecycle Operations.

Relish is a third-party supplier intelligence platform that validates supplier data while working on supplier cases. The integration supports the following validation types:

-   Supplier location validation for location change requests
-   Banking information and bank account ownership validation for banking details change requests
-   Tax information validation for tax change requests
-   Sanction screening for compliance verification

For more information, see [Review supplier information using Relish](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/supplier-lifecycle-operations/review-supp-info-relish.md).

To install the SLO Connector for Relish Data Assure, the following plugins must be installed:
