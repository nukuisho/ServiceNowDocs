# Working with outbound invoice

Validate invoice data with an ERP number, process the integration, and move the invoice to payment extraction.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_spend\_intg\_admin or sn\_spend\_intg\_procurement\_integrator

## Procedure

1.  Open `sn_spend_intg_outbound_invoice_list.do` staging table.

    The **Invoice record** is verified with ERP number.

2.  Set the **Integration status** to **Processed**.


## Result

The invoice **Status** is automatically set to **Pending payment**. The invoice is extracted for payment, and the invoice status is set to **Paid**.
