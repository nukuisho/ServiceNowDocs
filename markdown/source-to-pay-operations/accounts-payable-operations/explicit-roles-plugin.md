# Explicit roles plugin

The Explicit Roles plugin controls which users can access APO by requiring every user to have at least one explicit role assignment.

As of the Paris release, no user can have both of the explicit roles \(snc\_internal and snc\_external\).

Groups and role containment can't include both roles, since that would cause any group member or user assigned to such a group or a role to automatically have both roles.

The ServiceNow AI Platform aborts any operation that would create such a scenario.

You must install the Explicit Roles \[com.glide.explicit\_roles\] plugin while installing Accounts Payable Operations. The Accounts Payable Operations plugin is dependent on the Explicit Roles \[com.glide.explicit\_roles\] plugin.

Before you install the Accounts Payable Operations plugin, you must perform comprehensive analysis of the Explicit Roles \[com.glide.explicit\_roles\] plugin configuration to avoid conflicts or adjustments. This confirms seamless integration and operation of the plugins.

The installation of the Accounts Payable Operations plugin may cause access issues to the existing functionality that are controlled by the Explicit Roles \[com.glide.explicit\_roles\] plugin. You may have to manage or reconfigure certain roles and permissions managed by the Explicit Roles \[com.glide.explicit\_roles\] plugin for seamless integration and operation of existing functionalities. For more information on explicit roles, see [Explicit Roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/explicit-roles.md).

Frequently asked questions.

Why does Explicit Roles plugin matter?

The Explicit Roles plugin \(com.glide.explicit\_roles\) is the first prerequisite that must be installed before any APO plugin. It enforces role-based access control at the explicit record level. If it is not installed or if its configuration is not analyzed before APO installation, access control for APO roles may not function as expected.
