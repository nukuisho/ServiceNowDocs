# Invoice Processing use case

Accounts Payable Operations integration with Document Intelligence provides the **DO NOT USE - Invoice Processing** use case.

The **DO NOT USE - Invoice Processing** use case identifies the information to extract invoice documents received as email attachments and determines how a user with the Accounts Payable Specialist role interacts with the extracted values in the Document Intelligence workspace.

**Note:** The **DO NOT USE - Invoice Processing** use case is read-only and cannot be edited.

The **DO NOT USE - Invoice Processing** use case contains the list of invoice fields to extract data from invoice attachments and stores this data in the invoice stage record. It also contains an extraction flow that populates the extracted invoice data into the invoice stage and invoice line stage records. The flow updates the Invoice stage status to Processing completed.

You can access this use case by navigating to **All** &gt; **Document Intelligence** &gt; **Use Cases** &gt; **DO NOT USE - Invoice processing**.

The **DO NOT USE - Invoice Processing** use case includes the following information.

Fields

</td><td>

Contains the list of invoice and invoice line fields to extract information from an invoice document. A field is a single piece of information to extract from an invoice document. In the use case, invoice date is of data type "Date field". For example, in case of ambiguous date format such as 01-02-2024, the use case \(the current use case\) interprets the date as month followed by day or vice versa through the DI administration configuration menu. The platform admin \[platform\_ml\_di.admin\] manually configures the use case in the DI administration menu.For the list of invoice and invoice line fields included in the **DO NOT USE - Invoice Processing** use case, see [Invoice and invoice line fields for Accounts Payable Operations integration with Document Intelligence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/accounts-payable-operations/use-case-field-list.md).
