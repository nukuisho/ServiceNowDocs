3.  In the Number column, select the link to the invoice that you want to create an invoice line for.

-   **[Invoice rejection modes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/accounts-payable-operations/invoice-rejection-modes.md)**  
Invoice rejection modes control how Accounts Payable Operations handles exceptions that require an invoice to be rejected, either automatically by the system or through manual review by an AP specialist.
-   **[Reject an invoice manually](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/accounts-payable-operations/reject-an-invoice-manually.md)**  
Review exceptions flagged for manual rejection and reject an invoice from the invoice case when AP specialist confirmation is required.
-   **[Credit memo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/accounts-payable-operations/invoice-type-credit-memo.md)**  
Credit memo invoices in Accounts Payable Operations represent reductions or offsets in amounts payable to suppliers and can be created for both PO and Non-PO invoices, with the system identifying them based on specific indicators such as negative amounts.
