# Advanced Work Assignment for Accounts Payable Operations

Set up Advanced Work Assignment \(AWA\) to automatically route work items to qualified agents in Accounts Payable Operations.

Set up the following components for AWA in Accounts Payable Operations

-   Service channels- A means of assigning specific tasks to APO agents and specialists. You can configure base channels which define the means through which a query is answered by the agents. Base channels may include chats, invoice inquiry cases, messenger, and walk-up centers. You can create a service channel and set attributes such as agent capacity and agent skills. These attributes define the work handled by the agent or agent group.
-   Work item- Work handled by the agent from start to completion.
-   Work item queue- Queue that stores work items for a service channel.
-   Assignment groups- Agents belonging to specific groups categorized by the type of work assigned to them.
-   Agent capacity- Number of items on a service channel that an agent can work within defined time.
-   Agent availability- States that indicate whether an agent is busy, available or offline. AWA uses agent availability to determine if an agent is able to receive work.
-   Inbox layout- A configuration tied to a service channel that defines which fields of a record representing a work item are shown in agent inboxes. A layout defines what the agent sees in Account Payable Operations workspace.
