# Email resolution notifications for APO

AI worker agent resolves the case and moves it to awaiting acceptance, then sends an email with resolution details and accept/reject buttons.

The Accounts Payable Operations email resolution notification feature streamlines how suppliers and invoice owners receive updates about their Accounts Payable Operations cases. When a case is resolved and requires your acceptance or confirmation, you receive an email with the complete resolution details. The email includes action buttons that enables you to respond directly from your inbox, without needing to log in to the portal or navigate to a separate website.

## Key benefits

-   Faster resolution: Receive resolution updates immediately and respond from your email inbox.
-   Clear communication: Resolution details are presented directly in the email, eliminating the need to check a portal.
-   Streamlined response: Accept or reject resolutions with a single "click" using the action buttons.
-   Consistent behavior: Email buttons work the same way as portal actions for a seamless experience.
-   Reduced effort: No login required to respond to resolution notifications.

## How it works

When your Accounts Payable Operations case receives a resolution, the AI worker agent updates the case status to "Awaiting acceptance" to indicate that your confirmation or feedback is needed. The system automatically sends an email notification to your registered email address. The email contains the following:

-   The case reference number and case summary
-   Complete resolution details provided by the AI worker agent
-   Two action buttons: "Yes, this is resolved" and "No, I need more help"

When you select one of the action buttons, your response is recorded and the case status is updated accordingly. If you accept the resolution, the case closes. If you reject the resolution and request more help, the case is assigned to AP supplier services with New status for further investigation and assistance.\[Omitted image "email-notify-apo.png"\] Alt text: email notification sent to requester from APO

## When notifications are sent

Email resolution notifications are sent in the following circumstances:

-   A resolution has been provided to your case by the AI worker agent.
-   The case status has been changed to "Awaiting acceptance."
-   Your email address is registered in the system as the case requester or supplier contact.
