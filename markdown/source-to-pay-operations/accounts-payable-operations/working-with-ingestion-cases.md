# Invoice processing cases

Learn how Accounts Payable Operations integration with Document Intelligence creates invoice processing cases automatically from email attachments and how to manage cases that require manual creation. Verify whether the invoice data is complete and accurate.

By default, when an inbound email is received in Accounts Payable Operations integration with Document Intelligence, the invoice processing flow is triggered and an invoice case with a category of **Invoice automation** and sub-category of **Invoice processing** is created. For more information, see [Install Accounts Payable Operations integration with Document Intelligence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/source-to-pay-operations/accounts-payable-operations/apm-integration-docintel.md).

Frequently asked questions.

How do I activate orphan invoice processing?

Activate the Start Invoice Processing for Orphan Invoice flow in Flow Designer. This flow automatically picks up all PO and Non-PO invoice records in Draft status that don't have an associated invoice processing case and starts their processing. You only need this manual activation step if the flow was not already activated during installation.
