# Metric definition setting record fields

The fields of the metric definition setting record form are explained in this topic.

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Name|Name for the record. For example, `Default record for CMD calculations`.|
|Active|Option to mark the default values record as active.|
|One for null record|You can select relevant operators in the field. If a metric operand is null or undefined during formula execution, and the adjacent operator matches the one selected, the system assigns a default value of 1 to that operand—ensuring the calculation proceeds without error.|
|Order|Determines the priority of the record when multiple records are available. The record which has the highest number is selected|
|Skip null record|You can select relevant operators in the field. If a metric operand is null or undefined during formula execution and the adjacent operator matches the one selected, the system will skip that operand from the calculation. This prevents errors and ensures the formula continues without interruption.|
|Zero for null record|You can select relevant operators in the field.If a metric operand is null or undefined during formula execution and the adjacent operator matches the one selected in this field, the system assigns a value of 0 to that operand. This ensures the calculation proceeds without error and maintains consistency in results.|
|Type|Displays the type of metric definition. This field is automatically set to **Calculated metric definition**.|
|Table name|Specifies the name of the table where the default values are stored. This field is auto-populated.|
|Filter|Specifies the condition under which the default values defined in this record should be applied during CMD formula execution. You can setup multiple criteria conditions.|
