# Add and publish best practices to the article

Add your organization's custom best practices to the Catalog Best Practices article and publish them to make them available to the LLM.

## Before you begin

Role required: catalog admin

## About this task

The Catalog Best Practices article contains default best practices provided. Add custom best practices specific to your catalog item creation standards. Best practices only take effect when the article is published. Note that the article in a draft state is not considered by the LLM.

While editing the article, the previous published version remains active and is used by the LLM. This confirms no service disruption during edits.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All****Knowledge Base**.

2.  In the list of knowledge base, find and open the "Catalog Item Standards" knowledge base.

3.  Select the knowledge tab.

4.  Open the "Catalog Best Practices" article.

5.  Review the provided default best practices.

    **Note:**

    The default best practices act as templates for creating custom best practices aligned with similar intent and format.

6.  Select **Edit** to add custom best practices.

    **Note:**

    Only the "Catalog Best Practices" article is editable.

7.  Add your custom best practices using plain text formatting.

    **Note:**

    The LLM considers a maximum of 4,500 characters from the provided content \(best practices\) of the Catalog Best Practices article during catalog generation. Content exceeding this limit is not processed.

8.  Select **Save** to save your changes as a draft.

    Saving does not publish your changes. The article remains in draft status until you publish it.

9.  Review the complete article to confirm accuracy and alignment with your organization's standards.

10. You can preview how the LLM reads the best practices by reviewing the plain text formatting.

11. Select **Publish** to make your custom best practices active.

    Publishing immediately makes the article available to the LLM. The LLM reads only from the latest published version.
