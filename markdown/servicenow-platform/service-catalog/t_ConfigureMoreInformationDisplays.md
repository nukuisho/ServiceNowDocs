# Configure preview

Configure the number of items that have the **Preview** section expanded to display item details. You can also change the default number \(5\) of items and categories that display, and hide the **Exists in categories** information.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

By default, if not showing item details using pop-ups, the first two items listed in the category display have the **Preview** section expanded to display item details.

To change the number of items with this information expanded, set the **Number of Catalog Items to expand in browsing and search when not using pop-up icons to view details** \(glide.sc.auto\_expand\) property to the number required.

## Set number of items and categories to preview

By default, up to five items or categories appear in each category on the homepage.

### About this task

To change this number, set the **Number of Catalog Items/Categories to preview in a section** \(glide.sc.max\_items\) property to the required value.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>## Hide the existing categories in the categories display

By default, catalog items that are in several categories show **Exists in categories** information that shows other categories that the items are available in. You can hide this information.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  Set the **Show the additional categories section when viewing a catalog item**\(glide.sc.show\_additional.cats\) property to **No**.
