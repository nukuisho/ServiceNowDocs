# Restricting access to Hermes

Restrict access to Hermes by IP address.

You can filter client access to the Hermes cluster using the IP Address Access Control module. When IP address filtering is enabled, the system only blocks an IP address if a matching Deny rule exists and no matching Allow rule exists. By default, there are no restrictions on access to your instance.

To enable IP address filtering in the Hermes cluster, you must submit a request to Customer Service and Support.

For details on configuring access rules in the IP Address Access Control module, see [IP Address Access Control](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/t_AccessControl.md).

-   **[Create an alert for unauthorized access](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/multi-instance-framework-hermes/create-alert-notification-hermes.md)**  
Receive a notification when an attempt to access Hermes is received from an unauthorized IP address.
