# Exchanging data using Hermes

Produce and consume Kafka messages in your ServiceNow instance using the Hermes Messaging Service.

There are several methods for exchanging data between your ServiceNow instance and your Kafka environment using the Hermes Messaging Service. In all cases, data is produced from one entity and consumed by another.

## Using Stream Connect

With Stream Connect, you can produce messages from your ServiceNow instance using a Producer step from a flow action or the Producer API, and then consume the messages in your external application.

You can also produce messages from an external application and then consume the messages in your ServiceNow instance via any of the following methods:

-   Kafka flow trigger
-   ETL consumer
-   Transform map consumer
-   Script consumer

## Using Log Export Service

With the Log Export Service, you can produce logs from your ServiceNow instance, and then consume the logs in your external application.

## Using a Kafka client

With the Kafka standard protocol, you can exchange messages with any application that produces messages. For example, you can produce messages from a Java application using the standard Kafka protocol and then consume them in your ServiceNow instance and vice versa.
