</table>-   Verify that the host computer satisfies the [MID Server system requirements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server/r_MIDServerSystemRequirements.md).
-   The MID Server requires the minimum PowerShell version 3.0 and supports versions up to PowerShell 5.1.
-   Ensure that the Microsoft Application Experience Lookup Service is enabled on the MID Server host. If this service is disabled, the MID Server auto-upgrade might fail, causing the MID Server to go down. For information on managing issues with the Application Experience service, see [KB0597552](https://support.servicenow.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fkb_view.do%3Fsysparm_article%3DKB0597552).

Java 21.0.7 is bundled with the MID Server installer package and is installed on the host for all new MID Servers. The installer automatically configures Java 21.0.7 to run in your environment. No additional configuration is required. This version supports both 64-bit Windows MID Servers and 64-bit Linux MID Servers. The MID Server requires a minimum JRE version 17.0.10, and recommended version 21.0.7. If you are using a lower version than 17.0.10, you may see encryption related issues.

**Note:** ServiceNow no longer supports new installations of 32-bit MID Servers or upgrades to version Rome. New MID Server installation are blocked through RPM and MSI installer on the following operating systems:

-   CentOS 7
-   Windows server 2008
-   Windows server 2008 R2
-   Windows 8
-   Windows 10

MID Servers can be manually installed to any operating system with the ZIP file, however Windows 10 is unsupported. Unsupported MID Servers auto-upgrading to Rome create an issue record in MID Server Issues \(ecc\_agent\_issue\). For more information, see [Supported platform changes for MID Server \[KB0863694\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0863694).

Testing showed that the MID Server works as expected with Oracle Java 11 version 17.0.10. If you need to upgrade the JRE to a different version, then coordinate with the appropriate account representative for support.

Upgraded MID Servers might use different Java versions depending on their operating system versions.

-   MID Servers upgraded from earlier versions use the OpenJDK provided with the MID Server installer. This version of the OpenJDK was tested and certified for use with these MID Servers.
-   MID Servers upgraded on any other operating system versions also automatically upgrade the JRE to the version provided with the installation package.

## Install MID Server on Windows with private key JWT using ZIP

Using the ITOM Infra Services Workspace, MID Servers can be deployed and configured manually with a ZIP file.

### Before you begin

Role required: admin

### Procedure

1.  On the instance, navigate to **ITOM Infra Services Workspace**.

2.  From the home page, in the **Set up a MID** panel, select **Download a MID Server**.

3.  In the **Download and set up a MID Server** panel, select **Set up a MID Server**.

4.  To begin the installation process, provide the following information.

    -   **Authentication type:** ServiceNow certificate
    -   **I'm installing the MID Server on:** Windows
    -   **I want to install using a:** Manual configuration via zip file
    **Note:** If this is your first time installing a MID Server, use the command line installer instead of installing manually. See [Install MID Server with the command line installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server/mid-ipki-install-command.md) for more information.

5.  To proceed, select **Next: Configuration**.

6.  Provide the name of the MID Server.

    You can provide a note about the MID Server in the MID Server purpose field. This note does not affect anything about the MID Server's roles or performance.

    In addition, you can reveal the **Advanced configuration settings** to **Manually set MID Server user**, provide the IP address and port number for **Proxy configuration**, or **Manually set service name**.

7.  To configure a Service Account, create a dedicated non-admin service account for the MID Server.

    This account must have the **Log in as a Service** right and **Read, Write, Execute** permissions for the MID Server installation folder. For more information, see [Configure Windows MID Server service credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/mid-server/mid-server-install-prereqs.md).

8.  Download the Windows ZIP file from the installation plan.

9.  On the Windows host machine, extract the ZIP file into the intended install directory for the MID Server.

10. Go to the installation plan and generate a token to register your ServiceNow-provided certificate.

    This token allows a new MID Server to authenticate to this instance for the first time. It is single-use and expires in 24 hours. You can regenerate this key if needed.

11. Paste the code block into the `config.xml` file.

    **Note:** This token is generated with a default MID Server user. If you want to use a specific MID Server user, select **Specify MID Server user** to generate the token.

12. To configure your MID Server, navigate to the agent folder and configure the following properties in `config.xml` with a text editor:

<table id="table_hqp_4lj_mjc"><tbody><tr><td>
