# Installing MID Server on Linux

Using the ITOM Infra Services Workspace, MID Servers can be deployed to Linux with a variety of authentication and installation methods. For authentication, choose between private key JWT, basic authentication, or mutual authentication.

</table>To install Linux on MID Server, the RedHat/CentOS systems require RPM while Debian \(Ubuntu\) systems require DEB. The default installation location is `/opt/servicenow/mid`. Installing DEB in user defined directories is not supported.

To improve security, this procedure installs and run the MID Server service as a non-root user. Root privilege is required to deploy and configure a MID Server on a Linux server. A non-root user can manage a service only if they have the required permissions. For more details, see [PolicyKit issues with Linux MID Servers using non-admin accounts \[KB0815542\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0815542).

**Note:** ServiceNow no longer supports new installations of 32-bit MID Servers or upgrades to version Rome. New MID Server installation are blocked through RPM and MSI installer on the following operating systems:

-   CentOS 7
-   Windows server 2008
-   Windows server 2008 R2
-   Windows 8
-   Windows 10

MID Servers can be manually installed to any operating system with the ZIP file, however Windows 10 is unsupported. Unsupported MID Servers auto-upgrading to Rome create an issue record in MID Server Issues \(ecc\_agent\_issue\). For more information, see [Supported platform changes for MID Server \[KB0863694\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0863694).

Java 21.0.7 is bundled with the MID Server installer package and is installed on the host for all new MID Servers. The installer automatically configures Java 21.0.7 to run in your environment. No additional configuration is required. This version supports both 64-bit Windows MID Servers and 64-bit Linux MID Servers. The MID Server requires a minimum JRE version 17.0.10, and recommended version 21.0.7. If you are using a lower version than 17.0.10, you may see encryption related issues.

**Note:** Linux MID Servers require glibC version 2.17. The library must be updated for JRE 11. On 64-bit Linux systems, you must install the 32-bit [GNU C library](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) \(glibc\). The installation command for CentOS is: `yum install glibc.i686`

Testing showed that the MID Server works as expected with Oracle Java 11 version 17.0.10. If you need to upgrade the JRE to a different version, then coordinate with the appropriate account representative for support.
