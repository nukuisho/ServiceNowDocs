# Recommend service graph connector agentic workflow

Sometimes you're not sure which integration to use to capture CI data. When you provide Now Assist with then name of a particular CI class, it can recommend the data sources or Service Graph Connectors and ingestion sources that can best populate CMDB data.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_admin or cmdb\_inst\_admin

## About this task

Incomplete CI data can lead to poor business outcomes and loss of trust in business-facing applications like Hardware Asset Management, IT Service Management, and ITSM Software Asset Management. Sometimes you're not sure which integration to use to capture required CI attribute data for a particular class \(and, by extension, which associated business outcomes are affected when the data is missing\). Now Assist provides recommendations for integrations that would help to capture the required data.

## Procedure

1.  Select the Now Assist icon \[Omitted image "icon-now-assist-sparkle.png"\] to open the Now Assist panel and then perform the following procedure.

    1.  To start the process, enter text similar to `recommend an SGC`.

    2.  Enter the classes that you want to populate.

        Include the `cmdb_ci` prefix in the class name. Optionally, specify the attributes that you want to populate.

        |Example prompt to start the process|Example CI classes|Example attributes|
        |-----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
        |recommend sgc|cmdb\_ci\_computer|all fields|
        |recommend connectors|cmdb\_ci\_aix\_server|name, serial\_number, model\_id|
        |recommend sgc integrations|cmdb\_ci\_hardware|all attributes|
        |suggest connectors|cmdb\_ci\_cloud\_database, cmdb\_ci\_server, cmdb\_ci\_ip\_address|\[If no attributes are specified, Now Assist assumes all attributes.\]|

    Now Assist presents the recommended Service Graph Connectors for the classes and attributes that you specified.

    -   The list includes all data sources that populate the classes that you specified.
    -   The list is ordered by the number of classes supported.
    -   A connector might be listed for multiple classes.

2.  Follow the guidance on the Now Assist panel to determine the SGC connection to use or the Service Graph Connectors to install and configure for the data set that you specified.

3.  Provide feedback, copy the response text to the clipboard, or refresh the response.

If you think that the response was helpful, select thumbs-up \[Omitted image "icon-thumbs-up.png"\]. If you think that it wasn’t helpful, select thumbs-down \[Omitted image "icon-thumbs-down.png"\].This feedback improves the agentic AI model and can help to improve the future versions of this skill. The system gathers the feedback on each generated response and stores it in the agentic AI logs \(sys\_generative\_ai\_log\_list.do\).
