# Let Now Assist help you to manage duplicate CIs

Resolve deduplication tasks with support from the Now Assist Manage duplicate CIs skill. CMDB administrators follow step-by-step guidance to perform remediation, and can preview remediation results before applying a template.

## Before you begin

Role required: cmdb\_dedup\_admin and now\_assist\_panel\_user

## About this task

This procedure describes how you can manually access the skill. In addition, any agentic workflow can use the skill.

When a Now Assist skill is enabled, the Now Assist icon \[Omitted image "icon-now-assist-sparkle.png"\] appears in the toolbar of the workspace.

## Procedure

1.  On the Service Graph Workspace orCMDB Workspace or in any form or list view, select the Now Assist icon \[Omitted image "icon-now-assist-sparkle.png"\] and then select **Manage duplicate CIs** in the Now Assist panel \(or enter similar text\).

2.  Follow the guidance on the Now Assist panel to remediate duplication.

    As you select options to remediate duplication, the skill adjusts the options and guides you through the process.

Review root causes for duplication: The analysis surveys IRE identification rules \(including criterion attributes\) and discovery sources and responds by grouping causes to suggest related groups of tasks.

 **Tip:** Use this information to help avoid further creation of duplicate CIs.

Decide which de-duplication template to apply: Select **Review existing templates** and then follow the suggestions to preview the results of applying the template.

</td><td>

Without actually running the remediation process, Now Assist generates a preview of the results of applying a template. You can preview the results for any existing template. When you see the desired result in a preview, you can specify that template and proceed with the de-duplication process.
