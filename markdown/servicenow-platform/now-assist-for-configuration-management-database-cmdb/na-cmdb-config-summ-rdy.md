# Configure the summarize CMDB readiness skill

Review and configure the settings of the summarize CMDB readiness skill to control its availability and to enable an AI-generated summary of the CMDB success advisor dashboard data.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## About this task

The summarize CMDB readiness skill reads the data findings and suggest remediation actions that the CMDB success advisor for HAM dashboard displays. The skill uses the Now LLM Service to generate the summary.

Requirements and dependencies

</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

CMDB success advisor

</td><td>

The CMDB success advisor application must be installed and active. The skill draws its inputs from the findings and the recommended remediation actions that the dashboard surfaces.

</td></tr><tr><td>

HAM

</td><td>

Set up the CMDB success advisor for Hardware Asset Management \(HAM\). See [Set up CMDB success advisor for HAM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/cmdb-sa-ham-config-settings.md).

</td></tr><tr><td>

Now Assist for CMDB

</td><td>

The Now Assist for Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\) application provides the skill. Activate the application from the **Now Assist Admin** console before you configure the skill.

</td></tr></tbody>
</table>By default, all skills exist in the global domain. When you use AI in a domain-separated environment, users are only able to access data in their domain. For example, if a user uses the summarization skill, AI only uses material that exists in the user's domain when generating that summary. Additionally, there is no co-mingling of data for domain-separated instances when using generative AI skills. The data resides only on the instance, and the shared services used for generative AI do not persist any requests \(prompts\) and responses. For more information, see [Domain separation in the Now Assist Admin console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/domain-separation-in-the-now-assist-admin-console.md). \(Note that global domain is not the same as global scope. For more information, see [Exploring Next Experience pickers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-user-interface/next-experience-pickers.md).\)
