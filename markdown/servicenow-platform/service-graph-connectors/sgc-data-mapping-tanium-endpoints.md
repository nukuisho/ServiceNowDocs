# Data mapping for Service Graph Connector for Tanium Endpoints

Data from the Tanium data sources is mapped and transformed into the ServiceNow CMDB configuration item \(CI\) class definitions using the Robust Transform Engine \(RTE\). Data is inserted into the ServiceNow CMDB using the Identification and Reconciliation Engine \(IRE\).

When you complete setting up the connection, you can configure the integration to periodically pull data from Tanium.

**Important:** The Service Graph Connector for Tanium Endpoints populates the Computer class with user-facing endpoints, and doesn't import data from the Server child class. Use this connector if you don't require Server data. If you require Server data, use the Service Graph Connector for Tanium.

The following table lists the data sources, the staging tables, and the target tables as CMDB CI classes for the Service Graph Connector for Tanium Endpoints.

The SG-Tanium Remove Software data source creates import sets and uses the transform map-based method for removing any target records for software data that weren't updated in the last delta query check.
