# Configure a service account

Create a service account to bind the API token that is used by the Service Graph Connector for Tanium Endpoints. If a service account for the integration already exists, edit it to assign the required roles.

## Before you begin

Role required: Tanium administrator

For more information, see [Creating API tokens for ServiceNow](https://help.tanium.com/bundle/Security-Operation-Integration/page/ServiceNow_Integrations/Create_API_key.htm).

## Procedure

1.  Log in to the **Tanium Endpoint Console**.

2.  Navigate to **Administration** &gt; **Permissions** &gt; **Users**.

3.  Add a new user or edit an existing integration user:

    -   Select **New User**, and then specify a user name.
    -   If an integration user already exists, select the **Name** of the user, and then select **Edit Mode**.
4.  Assign the required roles:

    -   Interact Basic User
    -   Asset User
    -   Gateway User
    Manual permission configuration isn't required because these roles automatically assign all the necessary permissions \(such as Gateway API access and Sensor read access\).

5.  If the integration uses additional sensors, assign read permission for the additional sensors, and then enable access to their content sets.

6.  Assign the required Computer Group access to import data.

    If Computer Group access isn't assigned, data won't be returned after an API call.

7.  Select **Save** to complete the configuration.
