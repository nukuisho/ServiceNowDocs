# Remediate a single de-duplication task

Remediate a single de-duplilcation task using a de-duplication template in CMDB Workspace, or manually, using the Duplicate CI Remediator.

## Before you begin

-   Review the following topics to familiarize yourself with important concepts of duplicate CI remediation:
    -   [Duplicate CIs remediation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database-cmdb/de-duplication-tasks.md): To learn about general duplicate CI remediation concepts, restrictions, and special cases such as remediations that involve a large number of duplicate CIs.
    -   [Properties related to remediation of duplicate CIs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database-cmdb/properties-duplicate-ci.md): To learn about important properties that affect processes of duplicate CI remediation. Including the glide.duplicate\_ci\_remediator.dry\_run property that determines if the Duplicate CI Remediator actually updates the CMDB or not.
-   To access the Now AssistServiceNow Otto remediation option in the Duplicate CI Remediation wizard, the De-duplication task resolution assistant skill must be installed and enabled.

    For more information about:

    -   Setting up ServiceNow Otto for CMDB, see [ServiceNow Otto for Configuration Management Database \(CMDB\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/now-assist-for-configuration-management-database-cmdb/now-assist-landing-cmdb.md).
    -   The De-duplication task resolution assistant skill, see [Resolving de-duplication tasks with ServiceNow Otto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/now-assist-for-configuration-management-database-cmdb/na-cmdb-skill-dupe-task-resolution.md).

Role required:

-   To access the [Governance view in CMDB Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database-cmdb/sg-workspace-governance-view.md) to perform de-duplication tasks: sn\_cmdb\_admin
-   To perform de-duplication tasks, cmdb\_dedup\_admin or any role containing cmdb\_dedup\_admin \(such as sn\_cmdb\_admin\)

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **CMDB Workspace** &gt; **Governance**.

2.  Select the **De-duplication Dashboard** link in Management tools, in the Manage section.

3.  In the De-duplication templates section, select **View de-duplication tasks**.

4.  In the De-duplication tasks list view, select the task that you want to remediate.

5.  Select **Remediate** on the task form.

6.  In the Remediate dialog box, choose which method you want to use for remediation, and then select **Remediate**.

**Use the Duplicate CI Remediator**

</td><td>

Use the Duplicate CI Remediator built on Core UI to remediate the task.

 To continue with this choice of remediation, see [Remediate a de-duplication task \(manual\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database-cmdb/reconcile-dup-task.md).

</td></tr><tr><td id="d268993e240">

**Use the Duplicate CI Remediator \(AI\)**

</td><td>

Use the De-duplication task resolution assistant skill to make suggestions for the de-duplication options, instead of manually selecting these options.

 The De-duplication task resolution assistant skill skips directly to the final dashboard of the Duplicate CI Remediator where you can review the selections made by the skill.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d268993e258">

**Use the Duplicate CI Remediator in Restricted Mode**

</td><td>

Appears only if the **glide.duplicate\_ci\_remediator.enable\_restricted\_mode** system property is set to **true**. You might need to use this option if remediation is blocked because loading the de-duplication task times out. This option might be relevant when there is a large number of related items associated with a de-duplication task, allowing remediation to continue with the limited features in a restricted mode. For more information about using this option to restrict the use of related items in de-duplication remediation and allow remediation to proceed, see [Using restricted mode within the Duplicate CI Remediator \[KB1542272\]](https://support.servicenow.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB1542272).

 To continue with this choice, see [Remediate a de-duplication task \(manual\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/configuration-management-database-cmdb/reconcile-dup-task.md). Skip to step \#5 in the procedure.

</td></tr><tr><td id="d268993e290">

**Remediate using a template**

</td><td>

Use a de-duplication template to remediate the task.

 To continue with this choice of remediation: In the Remediate dialog box, select the **Library** and the **Template** to use for the remediation, and then select **Remediate**.

</td></tr></tbody>
