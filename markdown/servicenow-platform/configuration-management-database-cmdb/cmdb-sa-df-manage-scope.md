# Manage principal classes in the Data Foundations advisor

Add or remove CI classes from the Data Foundations advisor scope to keep it aligned with your organization's current goals.

## Before you begin

Role required: sn\_cmdb\_admin

1.  On the Data Foundations advisor dashboard, select **Manage principal classes**.

2.  In the Set principal classes dialog box, add or remove CI classes to update your principal class selection.

    |Purpose|Action|Data coverage|

    |Expand CI class selection|Select **&gt;** to expand a group, then select check boxes for specific CI classes.|Includes only the selected CI classes associated with a group.|
    |Narrow down CI class selection|Select **&gt;** to expand a group, then clear check boxes for specific CI classes.|Excludes only the CI classes cleared from a group.|
    |Remove a CI class group|Clear the check box for the CI class group.|Excludes all CI classes associated with the removed group.|
    |Remove a selected CI class|Select X icon next to the category in the **Selected classes** column.|CI class is removed from scope.|

    **Note:** CI classes on the exclusion list aren't shown in the **Available classes** column.

## Result

The Data Foundations advisor dashboard updates to reflect the data based on the new principal class selection. Dashboard metrics refresh once daily when the **CMDB Advisor - DF Daily Data Collection** scheduled job runs. The scheduled job invokes the **CMDB success advisor data collection for Data Foundation** Performance Analytics job to recalculate the pre-aggregated indicators used throughout the dashboard. For more information about Performance Analytics jobs, see [Collecting indicator scores](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/now-intelligence/c_ClctData.md). Changes to your principal class selection appear in the dashboard metrics after this job's next run, not immediately.
