# Identify and review duplicate Knowledge articles

Review duplicate Knowledge articles using the identify and review duplicate articles feature in ServiceNow Otto.

## Before you begin

Role required: knowledge\_admin and knowledge\_manager

The ServiceNow Otto knowledge skill required to enable the identify duplicate articles feature is activated by the admin. To configure the skill, see [Configure and activate the identify duplicate articles skill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/now-assist-in-knowledge-management/Now-Assist-configuring-identify-duplicate-article-skill.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Knowledge** &gt; **Articles** &gt; **Duplicate Articles**.

2.  Expand each list of duplicate topics to view the duplicate Knowledge articles.

3.  Review the article categories and select the duplicate articles listed under it.

4.  From the **Actions on selected rows** menu select the **Unmark as Duplicate** action to be applied on the selected articles.

    **Note:**

    Articles unmarked as duplicates may reappear in the list during the next job run due to regrouping of records. Grouping happens during every job run. Records created after a job run are considered for the next schedule.

    This feature applies to new articles, published articles, new drafts, and articles in review.

    This feature does not work for non-English articles.
