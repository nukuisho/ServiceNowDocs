5.  Select **Use selected tasks to help draft new article** to generate the article.

    The completed article is displayed in the chosen template, along with the success message: `This article was drafted by Now Assist. Be sure to review it for accuracy before saving`.

    **Note:**

    -   If no similar tasks exist, this modal won’t appear, and the article is created. The generated article, based on the chosen relevant records, is linked to both the parent task and all the relevant cases selected.
    -   You can modify the draft before saving it. The article appears in a new tab with a unique ID number for the Knowledge article and is attached to the parent record.
    -   After reviewing the Now Assist generated article, when you select **Save** or **Publish**, the Now Assist success message disappears indicating that it’s no longer a Now LLM Service- generated article.
    -   If Now LLM Service fails to generate a result, an error message appears.
    -   When creating an article using Now Assist, once the process is triggered, it can't be stopped. Now Assist continues to generate the article even if you close the modal.
6.  Review the Now Assist generated article and select **Save** or **Publish**.

    The Now Assist success message disappears indicating that it’s no longer a Now LLM Service- generated article.
