## About this task

When a knowledge article is created using Microsoft Word, users accessing the knowledge article view page in a portal or workspace can download the source Microsoft Word document when the **sn\_km\_word.glide.knowman.enable\_document\_download** property is set to true.

    Alternatively, in your instance, enter `sys_properties.list` in the filter navigator.

3.  In the **Value** field, enter `true`.
