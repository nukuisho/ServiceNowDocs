# Elaborate or shorten content in ADRs

Elaborate or shorten the Architectural Decision Records \(ADR\) content using the Now Assist in the Enterprise Architecture Workspace.

## Before you begin

**Note:** Depending on your license, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents. For more information, see [ServiceNow product tiers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/ai-native-sku-overview.md).

Make sure that the ADR Doc Summarization and Actions skill is activated. For information, see [Configure Now Assist for Enterprise Architecture \(EA\)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/application-portfolio-management/configure-now-assist-ea.md).

**Note:** The ADR feature in Enterprise Architecture Workspace uses the ServiceNow Docs component \(sn\_docs\) to create pages in the Artifacts section. Docs component v6.0.0 is automatically installed with Enterprise Architecture Workspace v3.4.0.

If you're using an older version of Enterprise Architecture Workspace with Docs component v6.0.0, upgrade the workspace to v3.4.0 to fully use the ADR functionality. For more information, see [KB2017926](https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB2017926).

The default AI model provider for this skill is Azure OpenAI.
