# Set up the Jira spoke for Jira Cloud

Integrate your ServiceNow instance with the Jira Cloud instance to authenticate the requests from ServiceNow.

## Before you begin

-   Request an Integration Hub subscription.
-   Activate the Jira spoke.
-   Role required: admin.

## About this task

**Important:**

Starting with the Australia release, instructions for generating and using API tokens have been removed from our documentation to align with Atlassian's Acceptable Use Policy. See the Atlassian blog, [Building Secure and Scalable Integrations: Our Guidance for Third-Party Apps](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/developer/building-secure-and-scalable-integrations-our-guidance-for-third-party-apps) for more information.

## Option 3: Using basic authentication and API token \(does not comply with Atlassian security requirements\)

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and Jira Cloud instance using an API key to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

### Before you begin

**Important:** Apps that collect API tokens to create individual 3LO apps don't comply with Atlassian security requirements for cloud apps and Atlassian acceptable use policy.

Role required: admin.

### About this task

You can integrate a ServiceNow instance with multiple Jira instances. For this integration, create a connection and credential alias record and a connection record for each Jira instance.

### Generate an Atlassian account API token

Generate an Atlassian account API token to authenticate requests for spokes associated with an Atlassian account.

#### Before you begin

Make sure you have an Atlassian account.

Role required: Atlassian administrator credentials

#### About this task

Complete these steps from your Atlassian account. See the [Atlassian Developer](https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/) portal documentation for instructions on generating your API token.

**Note:** This procedure is applicable only if you are using the Jira Cloud subscription.

#### Procedure

1.  Log in to [Atlassian Start](https://start.atlassian.com/) as an admin.

2.  Go to your account profile photo and select **Account Settings**.

    \[Omitted image "jira-basic-settings.png"\] Alt text: Atlassian Start page with the drop down menu of the selected profile picture. Account Settings option emphasized.

3.  Go to **Security**.

4.  In the API token section, select **Create and manage API tokens**.

5.  Click **Create API token**.

6.  On the form, provide an integration name for the **Label** field.

7.  Click **Create**.

    \[Omitted image "jira-token.png"\] Alt text: The Create an API token modal with the Create button emphasized.

    The API token is generated.

8.  Click **Copy** and record the value of the API token for later use.

    \[Omitted image "jira-api-token.png"\] Alt text: Confirmation modal of Your new API token with the Copy button emphasized.


#### What to do next

Use your API token to configure the cloud connection for the Jira spoke.

### Configure a connection for Jira spoke

Add and configure a Jira connection to authenticate ServiceNow requests in Jira spoke.

#### Before you begin

Role required: admin

#### Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  Click the **Integrations** tab.

3.  Under **Connections**, the **Outbound** connections are displayed by default.

4.  Locate the **Jira** connection alias and click **View Details**.

    -   To configure the default connection and credential alias record that is shipped along with the Jira spoke, click **View Details**.
    -   To manage more than one Jira spoke connection records, you should create a new child alias record by clicking **Add Connection**. For more information about using multiple connections, see [Supporting multiple connections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/integration-hub/support-multiple-connections.md).
    If you are configuring the spoke for the first time, click **Configure**. Otherwise, click **Edit**.

5.  On the **Connection** form, fill in the fields.

    |Field|Description|
    |-----|-----------|
    |Connection Name|Name to uniquely identify the connection. For example, `Jira spoke cloud basic conn`.|
    |Connection URL|URL of your Jira instance in this format: `https://<provider-domain-name>.atlassian.net`.|

    \[Omitted image "jira-cloud-basic.png"\] Alt text: Connection configuration for Jira Cloud.

6.  Click **Create Connection**.


## Option 4: Using basic authentication with API token and scopes \(does not comply with Atlassian security requirements\)

Integrate the ServiceNow instance and Jira Cloud instance using an API key with scopes to authenticate ServiceNow requests.

### Before you begin

**Important:** Apps that collect API tokens to create individual 3LO apps don't comply with Atlassian security requirements for cloud apps and Atlassian acceptable use policy.

Role required: admin.

### About this task

You can integrate a ServiceNow instance with multiple Jira instances. For this integration, create a connection and credential alias record and a connection record for each Jira instance.
