# Now Assist for Zero Copy Connector ERP data query skill

Use the Now Assist ERP data query skill in Now Assist for Zero Copy Connector to identify SAP objects such as tables, BAPI, and OData endpoints.

## ERP data query overview

**Important:** This generative AI skill is turned on by default. The skill will be automatically available to appropriate role users for the application. For more information, see [Now Assist skills, agents, and agentic workflows on by default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/intelligent-experiences/now-assist-skills-on-by-default.md).

The ERP data query skill helps you identify SAP objects that can then be used to query the required data. For example, use ERP data query to obtain an OData endpoint.

This skill can help you create new ERP models and model operations more quickly by automating the identification of correct SAP data sources, eliminating the need for manual look up and deep technical knowledge.
