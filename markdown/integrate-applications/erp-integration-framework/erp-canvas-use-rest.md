# Connect Zero Copy Connector for ERP to SAP using REST

Extract data securely from ERP with REST for use in remote tables and extraction tables.

## Providing REST access to users

You must have an SAP system that has been enabled to make a REST connection. REST connections use the HTTP connection template. For more information, see [Create an HTTP\(s\) connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/platform-security/create-https-connection.md).

## Enabling download of XML files

The glide.attachment.extensions system property restricts the file types that can be downloaded. This property is empty by default. Check that the xml file extension hasn't been added to this property. For more information, see .

## Heartbeat information

For an ERP system, there are separate heartbeat indicators for RFC and HTTP. When a system is established, the heartbeats are set to active and the status is updated, including any errors. REST uses HTTP.

## Supported Workday APIs

Most Workday APIs are supported. For more information about services, see the [Workday REST Services Directory](https://community.workday.com/sites/default/files/file-hosting/restapi/) in the Workday Community.

**Note:** WQL is not supported, but can be configured using Zero Copy Trino. For a similar example, see [Create a ServiceNow Remote Instance connection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/integrate-applications/create-servicenow-remote-instance-connection.md).
