During the upgrade to Yokohama, the Financial Services Card Operations plugin reparents the Card Disputes Transaction table \[sn\_bom\_credit\_card\_disputes\_transaction\] to the Financial Task table \[sn\_bom\_task\] in Financial Services Operations Core.

 Reparenting leverages the benefits and advancements of ServiceNow® Financial Services Operations Core while preserving the functionality of existing applications.

**Note:** If your instance uses the Card Disputes Transaction table \[sn\_bom\_credit\_card\_disputes\_transaction\] and it contains a large amount of data, you may experience increased upgrade times.

Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[Visa Resolve Online \(VROL\) version 25.1 updates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=card-operations-reference&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Updated the following columns to align with release 25.1 revision changes:

    -   The **is\_parcelado** column has been removed from the dispute intake table.
    -   The domain value description for the **DisputeResponseReason** column has been updated from **Copy of ATM Cash Disbursement or Load Transaction** to **Copy of ATM Cash Disbursement**.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Workflow](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dispute-management-workflows&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Track the progress of the investigation workflow intuitively with a redesigned user interface that presents each transaction within a dispute case using a clear, process-based layout. This new layout visualizes the distinct stages of the investigation workflow, Investigate, Chargeback, and Closure, which enhances visibility and dispute management efficiency.


-   **[Resolving disputes with Mastercard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=work-on-disputes-integrated-with-mc&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Integrate the Dispute Management workflow with subflows that communicate with Mastercom, supporting an end-to-end dispute life-cycle from raising an initial dispute to final resolution.

-   **[Unified dispute intake experience](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dispute-intake-overview&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The dispute intake process has been streamlined to provide a clear, intuitive experience for customers and dispute agents, resulting in faster resolution and reduced manual effort. A unified interface now allows cardholders, account holders, and agents to raise disputes for both card and non-card \(ACH\) transactions seamlessly.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[Automated document submission in Mastercard transaction dispute process](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=chargeback-stage-mastercard&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Streamline the submission of supporting documents to Mastercard in the Mastercard Dispute Management workflow through document attachment and validation. Attached files are automatically checked against Mastercard requirements for file type and size. This update reduces the need for manual intervention, minimizes rework, and helps avoid rejection risk.

-   **[New subflow and action to support Card data security](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=card-data-security&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Support attaching documents to a specified table record using the following subflow and action in Card data security:

    -   Attach Document to Table Record
    -   Attach Tokenized Document to Table Record
-   **[Internal policy rule evaluation using dispute amount](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dispute-decision-tables&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Internal policy rules in the **Card dispute rules for internal policy** decision table now evaluate using the dispute amount instead of the original transaction amount. Previously, if a cardholder or agent modified the disputed amount while answering additional transactional questions during intake, policy rules still evaluated against the original transaction value. Rules now use the dispute amount field \(**sn\_bom\_credit\_card\_disputes\_transaction.dispute\_amount**\), so any amount adjustments made during intake are correctly reflected in rule outcomes.
