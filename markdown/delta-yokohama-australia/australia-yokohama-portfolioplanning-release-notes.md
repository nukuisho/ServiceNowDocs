-   **[Roadmap enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=planning-roadmaps-in-portfolio-planning&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

    -   Experience consistent roadmap bar colors for choice list attribute values across all portfolio plans.
    -   View the roadmap-level milestone row while scrolling down the Roadmap page.

-   **[Dynamic data linking in Docs](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=docs-for-planning-items-in-ppw&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Keep record information in your documentation always current and reduce manual effort with the Dynamic data linking feature in Docs. You can now reference any ServiceNow application record and Docs will automatically reflect the latest updates from those records. For example, if you add a reference to a Project record, the reference will show the latest field information of the project in Docs without requiring manual edits. Clicking the project reference opens up the project form so that you can view the full details of the project record and make any necessary changes. Dynamic linking also enables adding references to a particular field of a record, such as Assigned to of an Incident record.

You can add references from any ServiceNow table you have access to, with no setup or configuration needed, thereby eliminate the hassle of switching between applications to copy and paste data from various records into Docs.

-   **[Scenario planning enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=enable-scenario-planning-in-portfolio-planning&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

With the sn\_align\_core.apw\_admin role, you can enable or disable the scenario planning feature. The **sn\_align\_ws.is\_scenario\_planning\_disabled** system property allows you to enable or disable the scenario planning feature.

-   **[Quick filters enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=quick-fiters-prioitization-roadmap-ppw&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Apply filters using string-type and Boolean field values across the Planning page to view the required dataset. These filters are saved as part of your user preferences, enabling you to access the same filtered data when you log back in and continue your planning seamlessly.

-   **[Financial enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-financials-pp&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   View only the planned costs of your planning items to track the total cost of projects or demands.

    -   Manage the planned and actual monetary benefit plans for your projects to identify the financial performance of your project using the Cost and benefits screen.
    -   Use multicurrency to view and manage financial records of the project in Investment currency, which can be different from your functional currency. Manage multiple financial records such as planned and actual expenses, planned and actual benefits, and so on.

-   **[AI-generated insights for portfolio plans](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-portfolio-insights&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Gain AI-generated insights into planning items within a portfolio plan using the Portfolio insights skill. Identify planning items that are delayed beyond their planned end date, have delayed starts, or have misalignments between planned and approved dates. Monitor active projects that show early risk indicators but have not yet experienced delays. View AI-generated top root causes and recommended actions for each insight category to help address delays and misalignments effectively.

Users with the sn\_align\_core.apw\_admin role assigned can configure severity thresholds and scoring factors for planning items to control how the Portfolio insights skill classifies insight severity as Critical, Medium, or Low.

-   **[Next Experience for Demand Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=demand-workspace-ppw&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Manage strategic and operational demands in a unified experience in Portfolio Planning. This Next Experience interface consolidates demand creation, assessment, collaboration, and conversion in one place, eliminating context switching and reducing reliance on the classic Demand Workbench.

-   **[Create and manage demands in Next Experience for Demand Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=managing-demands-ppw&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Create and manage a demand in Next Experience for Demand Management using guided tabs. These tabs help you define alignment, estimate costs, and confirm readiness as you build out the demand.
    -   Collaborate on demands through Docs, which syncs execution and planning.
    -   View, add, and edit cost plans and budgeting details using related lists.
-   **[Use Playbook in Next Experience for Demand Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-playbooks-in-ppw&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Help teams manage demands with greater structure and consistency using Playbook in Next Experience for Demand Management.

Playbooks enable you to define multiple governance processes across the organization using a low‑code/no‑code configuration experience. Create clear stages and guided activities from demand intake to completion by using a default playbook or creating a custom playbook to support your organization’s multiple demand management processes.

-   **[Associate AI systems with demands in Next Experience for Demand Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=use-playbooks-in-ppw&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use a playbook activity in Next Experience for Demand Management to associate AI systems with a demand. You can link impacted systems and add new ones directly within the demand workflow.

-   **[Portfolio plan enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=work-prioritization-portfolio-planning&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Access the Hierarchy tab directly from the Planning page, located next to the Prioritization tab. This new placement replaces the previous access point within the Prioritization tab, providing a more efficient way to view and manage planning items.
    -   Save filter views specific to the Hierarchy tab without affecting views in the Prioritization tab.
    -   View planning items in the new Hierarchy tab on the Planning page, now sorted using global rank when available. Drag and drop is supported for lowest‑level items, enabling you to rerank them within their groups.
    -   Share a portfolio plan using the Copy link option. This provides access to existing users who have access to the portfolio plan.
    -   Make a portfolio plan public and share the copied link with Strategic Planning Workspace users, without inviting them individually or as a group. Note that users accessing a public portfolio plan with the shared link cannot view scenarios within the plan.
    -   Expand or collapse portfolio plan header to maximize screen space while planning.
    -   Edit the default view within a portfolio plan and save changes using the Save view option.
    -   View additional status attributes — cost, resource, schedule, and scope — for planning items in Portfolio Planning Workspace. For project planning items, these attributes are synced automatically from the latest published project status report. For other planning items, these attributes can be set manually. Note that project status report attributes synced from the Project status \(project\_status\) table are read-only in Portfolio Planning Workspace and can't be edited directly.
    -   Set planning item status to **No status** when a status has not been determined, in addition to the existing **Green**, **Yellow**, and **Red** values, giving planners the flexibility to update the status as needed. By default, the status is set **No status** when a planning item is created.
    -   Display rollup bars at parent levels in the hierarchy view and choose the date type to display — approved, planned, or actual. Use the comparison option to compare date types, such as approved versus planned dates, to identify schedule misalignments.
-   **[Plan efficiently with additional pre-defined lenses](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=lens-and-portfolio-plans&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the Planning item lens to plan, prioritize, and roadmap work in Strategic Planning Workspace directly with planning items, without configuring organization structure, programs, portfolios, or products. The lens supports all enabled work item types, such as projects and demands, and can be used as a standalone lens or alongside other lenses.

-   **[Financials for planning items](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-financials-spw&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

View the financial baselines in investment currency and project currency after migrating them from Classic to Next Experience. Migrated financial baselines include actuals, costs, benefits, and budget values from the project currency to the investment currency.

Using multicurrency, new and existing customers see only investment currency fields in demand and project records. Planned costs, actual costs, planned benefits, actual benefits, and budget fields are included in the financial baselines.
