Yokohama

</td><td>

-   **[Stream Connect for Apache Kafka alerting](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-alert&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Get alerts for your Stream Connect integrations. Stream Connect uses both active and scheduled monitoring to detect events across multiple Stream Connect components. If an issue is detected, an alert is created, and a message is logged to the Stream Connect Log.
    -   Specify alert thresholds by configuring alerting properties. For example, you can specify a maximum amount of time to process the current message queue. If the estimated processing time exceeds your specified time, an alert is generated.
    -   Receive alert notifications via email, SMS, or the ServiceNow® mobile app. Notifications contain detailed alert information, including the alert number, level, and a description. You can configure notification settings based on alert types, severity, and user preferences.
-   **[View producer statistics in the Stream Connect dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-dashboard&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Get detailed information about Stream Connect producers and their performance, including a producer’s status and type, the number of bytes and messages produced to a topic, and producer data trends over time, in the Stream Connect dashboard.

-   **[Check data usage in the Stream Connect dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-dashboard&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

View total data usage and data usage per month and topic with the Stream Connect dashboard. Data usage history is available for the last 12 complete months plus the current month.

-   **[Use error evaluation with Data Stream actions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-stream-actions&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Catch step errors and specify error behavior for each step in a Data Stream action. Create your own error conditions by specifying when an action returns an error state and the status codes and messages they return.

-   **[View connection aliases in integration actions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=managing-connections-integration-hub&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Edit, configure, and create connection aliases in the Action Properties section of actions in ServiceNow® Workflow Studio. View connection error details for connection aliases that are not set up or configured.

Zurich

</td><td>

-   **[Generate the parsing phase for REST-based Data Stream actions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=data-stream-actions&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Automatically configure the splitter step, script parser step, and outputs for REST-based Data Stream actions. The **Test REST step** functionality in REST-based Data Stream actions executes a request to the configured REST endpoint, analyzes the response payload, and automatically sets up the parsing and output components.

-   **[Stream Connect enhancements](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-apache-kafka&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   Use a MID Server cluster, instead of a single MID Server for [message replication](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-message-replication&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US). With a MID Server cluster, if one of the MID Servers fails, the other MID Servers can share the load of the failed MID Server.
    -   In the [Kafka subscription record](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=kafka-subscriptions-statistics&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US), view the estimated time required for a consumer to process the current queue. The subscription record also links to the consumer record, so that you can see which consumer is processing the queue.
    -   Specify a compression format for Stream Connect producers with the **com.glide.kafka\_producer.compression\_type** system property. Stream Connect supports the GZIP and LZ4 compression formats.
-   **[View alerts in the Stream Connect dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-dashboard&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Get detailed information about alerts, including their severity level, state, type, and the affected entity in the Stream Connect dashboard.

-   **[Test connection aliases directly from configuration templates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=test-alias-configuration-template&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

For aliases using a configuration template, you can configure a Test Action field. This field enables you to test a connection from within the Action Properties section of actions in Workflow Studio.

-   **[Support for PowerShell version 6.0 or later in the PowerShell step](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=powershell-step-action-designer&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable the PowerShell step to use a newer version of PowerShell by adding the MID Server property **mid.property.ihub.prefer\_powershell6Plus** and setting it to `true`.

-   **[Use WS-Security in a SOAP step on a MID Server](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=soap-step-action-designer&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Enable a WS-Security policy in a SOAP step running on a MID Server.

-   **[Delay parallel loading in custom \(load by script\) data sources](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=custom-type-data-source&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure a delay for parallel loading in custom data sources. When the data source is called, the parallel loading is scheduled to run after the configured amount of time.

-   **Spoke-specific AI agents**

AI agents that implement different agentic workflows are available for various spokes. Use these spoke-specific AI agents to execute agentic workflows.

-   **[Save draft, publish, update external trigger definition, and support domain separation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-saved-external-trigger&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

The external trigger definition is updated to match the trigger builder so that the external trigger definition supports the saving of draft, publishing, updating external trigger definition, and supporting domain separation.

-   **[Create and manage external event sources](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-external-event-sources&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Define and manage custom trigger definitions after creating external event sources.

-   **[Use Direct Kafka to integrate your on-premise ServiceNow instance with your local Kafka environment](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=direct-kafka&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Configure a custom Kafka connection to enable your on-premise instance to connect directly to your local Kafka environment.

-   **[Create topic aliases for Stream Connect topics](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=manage-topic-alias&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use topic aliases to simplify topic management in Stream Connect. A topic alias is a unique topic name that can be connected to any underlying Hermes or Direct Kafka topic. A topic alias can be moved to different instances and, wherever they’re moved, connected to an underlying topic.

-   **[Stream Connect Dashboard updates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-dashboard&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**
    -   The Topics menu displays topic aliases, Hermes topics, and Direct Kafka topics.
    -   The **Data usage** tab shows data for the Hermes cluster or the Direct Kafka cluster. Use the **Kafka Cluster** list to select which cluster data to display.
    -   The Consumers and Producers menus reference topic aliases instead of Hermes topics.
-   **[View the Remote Process Sync Dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=remote-process-sync-dashboard&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

View detailed statistics and monitor the health of your Remote Process Sync \(RPS\) integrations. The Remote Process Sync Dashboard provides real-time visibility into key metrics, including records processed, queue sizes, processing times, and system status. Use this dashboard to identify issues, track performance trends, and promote smooth operation of your RPS integrations.

-   **[Produce messages to Hermes via a MID Server](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=MID-hermes-API&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Send message payloads to Hermes with MID script includes.

-   **[View usage metrics for Direct Kafka](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=direct-kafka-usage-metrics&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Track data usage between your instance and Direct Kafka systems. The Direct Kafka Usage metrics table provides administrators with visibility into data transfer volumes for bytes produced and consumed. View metrics aggregated by hour, day, or month at the cluster and topic level. Usage records are automatically retained for 13 months.

-   **[Use the read-only role for Stream Connect](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=stream-connect-apache-kafka-roles&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use the new read-only role for Stream Connect to grant users view-only access to Stream Connect resources. Users with this role can view Stream Connect configurations and runtime statistics across all related modules, but can’t create, modify, or delete any Stream Connect settings.

-   **[View logs for Stream Connect producers](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=producer-statistics&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Get detailed log information for producers in the Stream Connect logs. Use the **glide.ih.kafka.producer.message\_bytes\_to\_log** property to specify how much of the message to display in the logs.

-   **[Configure alert thresholds for undelivered messages in Stream Connect](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sc-alert-properties&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Set alert thresholds for undelivered messages based on how long a topic has gone without receiving new messages. Use this configuration to trigger INFO, WARNING, or CRITICAL alerts when message delivery stops for a specified period.

-   **[Configure alert thresholds for unprocessed messages in Stream Connect](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=sc-alert-properties&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Set alert thresholds for messages that remain unprocessed in a topic. You can trigger alerts based on how long messages sit in a topic without being consumed, helping to identify lagging or failing consumers.

-   **[Get metadata information for Stream Connect consumers](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-script-consumer&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

View the partition, offset, datacenter ID, and timestamp epoch for the script consumer and Kafka Message trigger.

-   **[View message timestamps in the Stream Connect script consumer](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-script-consumer&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Get the message timestamp in the script consumer as a UTC time-zone string. You can use the UTC time-zone string to convert the timestamp to a **GlideDateTime** object.

-   **[Use an error subflow template to create your own error subflows in Remote Process Sync](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=getting-started-with-remote-process-sync&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Copy and modify the RPS Error Subflow Template to create error subflows. The template enables you to select notification methods for when the Inbound and Outbound States are errored.

-   **Specify attachment details in Remote Process Sync actions**

Specify the max attachment size and allowed attachment extensions in the [Identify New Attachments action](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=identify-new-attachments-action&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US) and the [Get Attachment Metadata for Local Record action](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=get-attachment-metadata-local-record-action&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **Use a new retry policy for Remote Process Sync actions**

Retry failed requests at specified intervals with the RPS Push Attachment Policy. This policy works with the [Identify New Attachments action](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=identify-new-attachments-action&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US) and the [Get Attachment Metadata for Local Record action](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=get-attachment-metadata-local-record-action&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US).

-   **[SASL authentication support for Apache Kafka connections](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-data-input-kafka-credentials&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**
