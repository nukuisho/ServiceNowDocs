# Combined AI Search release notes for upgrades from Yokohama to Australia

Consolidated page of all release notes for AI Search from Yokohama to Australia.

## How to use this page

To help you prepare for your upgrade, we have combined the cross-family AI Search release notes onto one page. Read this summary of the new features, changes, and updated information for your product from Yokohama to Australia.

**Tip:** If there were no updates for a release notes section in a certain family release, we included a short note for your reference. For example, if a product did not have any updates in Tokyo, the row says "No updates for this release."

-   **[Improve search precision and contextual relevance with hybrid search](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hybrid-search-ais&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Beginning with Now Assist in AI Search 15.0, customers with Now Assist in AI Search installed can enable the new hybrid search mode. Hybrid search combines keyword-based search with semantic understanding to deliver more accurate and relevant search results, with fewer zero-result searches.


-   **[Improve semantic search with third-party embedding models](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ais-rag&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Use custom and third-party embedding models supported by the AI Search RAG application to generate more accurate and relevant semantic search results.


-   **[Limit the number of Task and Alert records indexed with indexed source guardrails](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=indexed-source-guardrails-ais&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Index guardrail settings restrict index size and increase search performance by limiting the number of Task and Alert table records indexed for search.

-   **[Exclude search sources in a search profile from search result or Genius Result generation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=genius-results-ais&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Tune your search results by configuring search source exclusion settings in your search profiles. You can exclude a search source from being used to generate regular search results, Genius Result answers, or both. When excluding a search source's records from Genius Result answer generation, you can also choose to exclude its attachments.

-   **[Knowledge block content indexing](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=exclude-know-blocks-ais-index&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

When you index knowledge articles for search, AI Search now includes content from knowledge blocks to improve search recall. Administrators can disable indexing of knowledge block content if desired.

-   **[Boost relevancy for search results that match synonyms from a synonym dictionary](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=boost-results-ais&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

-   **[Filter external content search results by language](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=language-filtering-external-content&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

AI Search filters external content search results, displaying only results that contain content in languages relevant for the user's search. These languages include:

    -   The search user's session language
    -   The fallback language for the user's session language \(if configured\)
    -   The language of the global fallback locale \(if configured\)

-   **[Configure AI Search as the source for Ask Now Assist suggestions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-ai-search-source-ask-now-assist-suggestions&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Admins can configure the system to use AI Search as the source for Ask Now Assist suggestions in enhanced chat. Making this change activates suggestion term highlighting in Ask Now Assist and provides improvements such as wildcard searching and lemmatization for suggestions.

</td><td>

-   **[Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=now-assist-multi-content-qna-genius-results&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

If you have Now Assist in AI Search installed, Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results are supported in global and workspace search. Activating Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results in global or workspace search profiles overrides all other Genius Result configurations, so that global and workspace searches only display Genius Result answers from Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Results. Virtual Agent topic citations from Now Assist Multi-Content Response Genius Result answers in global or workspace search open the selected topic in the Now Assist panel so the user can continue their conversation on that topic.

-   **[Search Suggestions](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=search-suggestions-overview&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Search administrators with the ais\_admin granular admin role can access all Search Suggestions tables. Assign search administrators this role to eliminate needless propagation of full admin access.

-   **[Gain insights into search behavior with a refreshed and updated Search Preview UI.](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=search-preview-ui-new&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Preview search query results using settings from a search application configuration or a search profile. Choose between keyword and hybrid search modes. Display search results as individual EVAM cards or as a JSON-format search query response object, with search and syntax highlighting. Review search query behavior and results and specify search query settings with the new Summary, Genius Results, Details, and Profile admin tools.


-   **[Consumer-grade search experience for search portals](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=viewing-search-results-ais&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The search results page for search portals has been revised to offer a more intuitive and consistent experience. Navigation tabs have been replaced with source facet buckets. All search results now open in a new browser tab, preserving your search in the existing browser tab. Facet buckets now show minimum search result counts, reflecting results removed by late binding content security. Search terms are no longer highlighted in search results.

-   **[Consumer-grade search experience for global search and workspace search](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=using-ais-next-experience-app&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

The search results page for global search and workspace search has been revised to offer a more intuitive and consistent experience. Navigation tabs have been replaced with source facet buckets. All search results now open in a new browser tab, preserving your search in the existing browser tab. Facet buckets now show minimum search result counts, reflecting results removed by late binding content security. A new **glide.ui.ais.show\_all\_facets** system property enables you to display facets from all sources when no source is selected. \(The default behavior is to hide facets until a source is selected.\) Search terms are no longer highlighted in search results.

-   **[Sort facet buckets alphabetically](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-facet-ais&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Override the default sorting of facet buckets by their search result counts and display them sorted alphabetically by their labels.

-   **[Improved display for grouped attachment search results](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grouping-attachment-srch-results-ais&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

When grouped with their parent search results, attachment search results now appear in collapsed form to save space. If a parent search result includes more than three grouped attachments, you can use the new **Show more** and **Show less** links to control how many attachments are visible.
