-   **[Pull data from Splunk regularly using the Splunk Polling data input](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-data-input-splunk-polling&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Fetch data consistently over time by using the Splunk Polling data input, which sends recurring queries \(polls\) to Splunk. Handling most configurations on the HLA side, you need minimal additional stakeholder involvement, enabling swift integration with your existing Splunk setup. This enhancement accelerates proofs of concept \(POCs\) and enables faster iterations using real data.

-   **[Use your Splunk data input to ingest pre-processed data from Splunk](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-data-input-splunk&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Ingest data from Splunk in a preprocessed, structured format using your existing Splunk data input for streaming log messages to Health Log Analytics with a heavy forwarder.

-   **[Create Group automation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=group-alert-sow-itom&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

View key details from the Test Automation section, including total alerts, alert groups, ungrouped alerts, and compression, to help track and optimize alert grouping efficiency. Simulate other group types, such as CMDB, ML, and text-based grouping. The simulation processes only alerts that match the condition filter.

-   **[Integrate with log data connectors from the Integrations Launchpad](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-data-input-setup-integrations&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Set up your log data connectors for HLA from the Event Management Integrations Launchpad in Service Operations Workspace for ITOM. The Integrations Launchpad provides a unified interface for convenient integration with log data connectors that feed raw log data from external sources into your instance. In this release, the Integrations Launchpad enables integration with the following connectors: Elasticsearch, ServiceNow System Logs, UDP, and TCP.

Starting in version 36.0.19, benefit from additional log data integrations for Splunk TCP/UDP, Splunk Poller, MID Server, Apache Kafka, Microsoft Azure Log Analytics, and REST API that can be easily set up through the Integrations Launchpad.

-   **[Set up an Amazon Data Firehose integration for real-time log data streaming from multiple sources](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=il-connector-hla-firehose&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 36.0.19, leverage an integration for streaming log data from Amazon Data Firehose directly to the collector service in ITOM Gateway, where it is queued and then processed by Health Log Analytics. This integration doesn't run on a MID Server and can be configured from the Integrations Launchpad.

-   **[View links between alerts in Network Traffic-based alert groups](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=el-network-traffic-based-link-view&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Once network traffic correlation is enabled, investigate network traffic alert group details and visualize connections through Link View in Express List®.

-   **[Facilitate Cribl log data ingestion by Health Log Analytics using the Cribl integration](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=il-connector-hla-cribl&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 37.0.15, use the Cribl log data integration to streamline Health Log Analytics data ingestion with Cribl. If your organization uses Cribl for filtering and routing large volumes of log data from various sources, the log format received by HLA is distinct from other types. The Cribl integration enables HLA to detect and separate transport headers from inner log messages in this format, forwarding only the inner message to the source type structure for processing. You can configure the Cribl integration conveniently through the Integrations Launchpad.

-   **[Leverage additional information available on the integration's Overview screen](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=il-connector-overview-tab&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 37.0.15, take advantage of additional information presented on the Overview screen. The screen now displays the ITOM Gateway in the log processing pipeline and the log streaming rate per minute, aligning it with the metrics for the MID Server and the HLA Engine. The Overview screen also shows the source time of the last processed log.

-   **[Benefit from enhanced Log Analytics alert group and mixed alert group functionality in the Express List](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=el-link-view&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 26.9.0, identify connected Log Analytics alerts and mixed alert group correlations faster using the Link View functionality. Utilize enhanced Now Assist Alert Analysis with additional context for Log Analytics alerts.

-   **[View visualizations of anomaly information for Log Analytics-based alerts and metric intelligence alerts in Express List®](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=view-anomaly-alert-display&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 26.9.0, review anomaly charts for Log Analytics alerts and Metric Intelligence alerts in the preview panel in Express List®.

-   **[Configure automatic resume for live updates when the live alert list is paused, and configure time ranges in Express List®](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=express-list&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 26.9.0, enable admins to configure the amount of time until the active display resumes after being paused in Express List®. Admins are also able to customize the time range options displayed in Express List®.


-   **[Map log data to service instances and components for alerts in context](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=il-connector-hla-map-business-context&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 38.0.16, map your logs to service instances and components so that Health Log Analytics can generate alerts in the correct context. Contextualizing your log data is especially important when the integration processes logs from multiple service instances and components.


-   **[Monitor ServiceNow instance logs with the ServiceNow Log Export data input](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-data-input-log-export&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 38.0.16, set up a data input for monitoring ServiceNow instance node logs from both Java code and JavaScript in Health Log Analytics.


-   **[Live updates functionality has been updated in the Service Operation Workspace Lists.](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=configure-alert-list-autofresh-settings&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 26.11.0, a new toggle switch allows users to enable or disable live updates. When the toggle is set to on, alerts are updated automatically. When the toggle is set to off, a badge displays the number of available updates until the page is refreshed manually. The setting is saved for future logins by the same user.

-   **[Explore the new Dependency view for an alert](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=dependency-maps&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 26.11.0, explore the new Dependency view for an alert. Access maps from the following locations:

    -   in the preview panel, in the Configuration item section for the CI topology
    -   in the Utilities panel of the alert record
    -   in the action drop-down menu
    -   in the Core UI alert form
-   **[Respond to multiple alerts in Express List](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=bulk-alert-response-express-list&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 26.11.0, run response actions on multiple alerts at the same time in Express List.

-   **[Enrich automation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=enrich-alert-sow-itom&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Introduced a new section **And finally** that contains two radio buttons that replace the previous **Continue running automations of this type** toggle switch.

    -   **Run other enrich alert automations** continues running automations with the same filter conditions.
    -   **Don't run other enrich alert automations** halts additional automations after execution, except those owned by other assignment groups.
-   **[Investigate alerts using Now Assist](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=nai-past-incidents&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Investigate alerts using Now Assist, which now uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation \(RAG\) process to enhance alert investigation. This enhancement enables the retrieval of highly relevant past incidents, providing accurate context and actionable insights. Now Assist also notifies users of those involved in past or present efforts to resolve similar issues, promoting collaboration and reducing duplicated efforts.

-   **[Component-based alert grouping is deprecated](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=hla-op-log-analytics-alert-types&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting in version 36.0.19, component-based alert groups are removed as Health Log Analytics adopts a streamlined, two-tier alert model: Log Analytics Group to Single Alert. It aligns alert representation with the service-level anomalies identified by Health Log Analytics, rather than individual host CIs. The update improves alert visibility, simplifies correlation, and enhances overall alert management efficiency.
