Starting with the Vancouver release, if you’re a VRM user upgrading to TPRM, from an earlier release, you must run each upgrade sequentially to ensure that fix scripts run correctly. This means upgrading from one release to the next rather than skipping to the latest release. Not running scripts in the correct order can result in data inconsistencies, broken functionalities, and conflicts.

 For more information on upgrading from VRM to TPRM, see [Third-party Risk Management upgrade information](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grc-tprm-upgrade-info&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US).

 For existing TPRM customers, after upgrading to version 20.2.4, data from the Industry column in the Company \[core\_company\] table is automatically migrated to the tprm\_industry column. Migration can take several hours depending on the number of records in the Company \[core\_company\] table. After migration, a system log message confirms that the migration is complete. Review the Company \[core\_company\] table content and update any customizations referencing the Industry field to use tprm\_industry. After verifying the migration and updating customizations, you can drop the Industry column.

</td></tr><tr><td>

Zurich

</td><td>

If you’re a VRM user upgrading to TPRM and upgrading to Vancouver or a later release from an earlier release, you must run each upgrade sequentially to ensure that fix scripts run correctly. For example, you must upgrade from Utah to Vancouver, Vancouver to Washington DC, and so on. If the scripts don’t run in the correct order, you can get data inconsistencies, broken functionalities, and conflicts.

After upgrading to version 21.0.x, you can enable the Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) by setting the Smart Assessment Engine enabled \(**sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.sae\_enabled**\) property. After setting this property, Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) becomes the default assessment engine and replaces the legacy experience. The transition isn’t reversible.

**Warning:**

Set this property in your non-production instances and conduct thorough testing before changing your production instances. Failure to do so may result in unexpected issues.

For more information on upgrading from VRM to TPRM and the differences between the Smart and Classic Assessment engines, see [Third-party Risk Management upgrade information](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=grc-tprm-upgrade-info&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US).

For existing TPRM customers, after upgrading to version 21.0.3, data from the Industry column in the Company \[core\_company\] table is automatically migrated to the tprm\_industry column. Migration can take several hours depending on the number of records in the Company \[core\_company\] table. After migration, a system log message confirms that the migration is complete. Review the Company \[core\_company\] table content and update any customizations referencing the Industry field to use tprm\_industry. After verifying the migration and updating customizations, you can drop the Industry column.

Australia

</td><td>

If you're a VRM user upgrading to TPRM and upgrading to Australia from an earlier release, you must run each upgrade sequentially to ensure that fix scripts run correctly. For example, you must upgrade from Xanadu to Yokohama, Yokohama to Zurich, and so on. If the scripts don't run in the correct order, you can get data inconsistencies, broken functionalities, and conflicts.

 After upgrading to version 21.0.x, you can enable the Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) by setting the Smart Assessment Engine enabled \(**sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.sae\_enabled**\) property. After setting this property, Smart Assessment Engine \(SAE\) becomes the default assessment engine and replaces the legacy experience. The transition isn't reversible.

**Warning:**

Set this property in your non-production instances and conduct thorough testing before changing your production instances. Failure to do so may result in unexpected issues.

Migration can take several hours depending on the number of records in the Company \[core\_company\] table. After migration, a system log message confirms that the migration is complete. Review the Company \[core\_company\] table content and update any customizations referencing the Industry field to use tprm\_industry. After verifying the migration and updating customizations, you can drop the Industry column.

 After upgrading to version 22.3.3, the `grc_business_user` and `grc_reader` roles are no longer directly inherited by TPRM roles. During upgrade, most users are automatically migrated to new feature‑specific roles. Users with custom role combinations may not be migrated automatically and require manual review before the grace period ends.

-   **[Pre-populate responses using questionnaires](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-assessing-tpr&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

If you have the Third-party risk assessor \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor\] or Third-party risk manager \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager\] role, you can enable third-party and engagement contacts to review and update responses only if necessary by pre-populating questionnaires for engagements and entities with responses from completed questionnaires that are associated with the same third party. The attachment, duration, and signature type responses are excluded. This feature also helps ensure data consistency and accuracy.

-   **[Microsoft Excel questionnaire template](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-excel-template-support&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

Streamline the due diligence process by enabling third-party and engagement contacts to respond to questionnaires using a Microsoft Excel template by downloading the questionnaire as a template, completing it according to the included instructions, and importing the final version into the Third-party portal. This feature update enhances flexibility by enabling third-party and engagement contacts to provide information outside the third-party portal. Third-party risk assessors \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor\] and Third-party risk managers \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_risk\_manager\] can access this feature and respond to questionnaires on behalf of Third-party and engagement contacts through the Vendor Management Workspace.

-   **[Codes and additional identification information for ICT third-party service providers](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-create-ICT-thirdparty-serv-prov-form&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

If you have the third-party assessor role \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor\], help ensure compliance with DORA regulations by adding additional code types and a legal name to third-party and third-party engagement records in the digital resilience third-party registers within the Vendor Management Workspace. Include this information when the legal name of a third party differs from its commonly recognized name, or when you need to record multiple identification codes like a EUID, LEI, or Country code. When supply chain, assessment, or contract records are associated with a third party or third-party engagement using the EUID code type, all relevant fields will be automatically populated.

-   **[Function types for ICT third-party service providers](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-create-new-function-form&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

If you have the third-party assessor role \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor\], help ensure compliance with DORA regulations by using Business capability as an additional function type for function records in the digital resilience third-party registers within the Vendor Management Workspace.

-   **[Multiple legal entities making use of the services for contracts](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-drtp-reg-contract&family=yokohama&ft:locale=en-US)**

If you have the third-party assessor role \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor\], add multiple legal entities that are using services as part of a contract record in the digital resilience third-party registers within the Vendor Management Workspace. Including all entities that are using services associated with a contract is essential for maintaining transparency, helping ensure compliance, and enhancing operational resilience.

-   **[Risk areas extended to internal assessments](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=create-sae-q-template&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with version 21.1.x, if you have the third-party risk admin \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_admin\] role, you can now configure risk areas with weighted questions and scored responses for internal assessments using the Smart Assessment Engine in the Vendor Management Workspace. Risk scores can be aggregated at the engagement level using customizable methods such as max, min, or average, and mapped to risk ratings based on business rules. Risk managers can override system-generated ratings with required justification, enabling expert judgment and helping ensure transparency in risk decisions.

-   **[Smart Assessment Engine advanced plugins](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-migrate-asmnt-sae&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with version 21.1.x, the following Smart Assessment Engine advanced plugins are automatically installed: Post Assessment Actions for Smart Assessments \[com.sn\_smart\_imp\_auto and com.sn\_impact\_fwk\] and Advanced Response Automation for Smart assessments \[sn\_smart\_resp\_auto\]. The Post Assessment Actions for Smart Assessments plugin lets Third-party risk admins \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_admin\] automate follow-up tasks, like notifications or workflow launches, after an assessment is completed. The Advanced Response Automation for Smart Assessments plugin automatically fills in assessment responses based on prior data or logic, streamlining and standardizing the assessment process.

-   **Feature-specific administrator role enhancements**

Starting with version 21.1.x, if you have a feature admin role you can now complete tasks that were initially reserved for users with the broader administrator role.

    -   Assign sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessment\_reviewer to users who perform assessments, manage dashboards, and require operational access.
    -   Assign sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.external\_assessment\_responder to users who need access to the third-party portal and to complete assessments.

**Note:** Administrator privileges no longer grant access to TPRM features. Users must be assigned an appropriate feature-specific role to access relevant functionality.

-   **Read-only field enhancements**

Starting with version 21.1.x, the following Third-party Risk Management plugins have security enhancements for read-only fields in this release:

    -   Third-party Risk Due Diligence \[com.sn\_tprm\_onboarding\]
    -   Third-party Risk Management \[com.sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt\]
    -   GRC: Vendor Portal \[com.sn\_grc\_vendor\_portal\]
    -   GRC: Profiles \[com.sn\_grc\]
    -   GRC: Compliance Assessment \[com.sn\_comp\_asmt\]

    -   ITAM applications \[com.snc.vendor\_core\]
-   **[Fourth-party assessment support in SAE](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-monitor-fourth-parties&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Starting with version 21.1.x, Fourth-party assessments are now supported after you enable the Smart Assessment Engine enabled \(**sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.sae\_enabled**\) property.

-   **[Enhanced contract records for Digital Resilience Third-party Information Register in Vendor Management Workspace](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-drtp-reg-contract&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

If you have the third-party assessor role \[sn\_vdr\_risk\_asmt.vendor\_assessor\], you can now associate multiple entities with a single contract record. This association indicates that all entities have signed the contract and are providing services that are associated with the contract. You can also configure contracts that are based on the supply chain and assessment, upload contract records, and generate reports in Microsoft Excel. To better track these entities and help ensure compliance with Digital Operational Resilience Management \(DORA\) regulations, related lists have been added to the existing contract records, and existing fields have been reorganized for better usability.


</td></tr><tr><td>

Australia

</td><td>

-   **[Consolidated assessment email notifications](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=set_sys_props_for_email&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.3.3, external assessment‑related email notifications are sent as a single consolidated summary instead of individual per‑event messages. Users can configure notification frequency, detail level, and delivery channel in their notification preferences. Multi‑language templates are available.

-   **[Assessment count mechanism updated in the third-party portal](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=vendor-portal&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.3.3, engagement assessment counts in the third-party portal include only active, pending, and in‑progress assessments. Previously, counts included inactive and canceled assessments.

-   **[Inactive metrics excluded when copying assessment responses](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-assessing-tpr&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.3.3, inactive and retired metrics are excluded when copying responses between assessments. Previously, copying responses could include inactive metrics, causing scoring errors.

-   **[Type of ICT services changes cascade to supply chain in DORA reporting](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-drtp-reg-contract&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading the Digital Resilience Third-party Information Register application to version 22.3.1, when the Type of ICT services value is updated on a Contractual Arrangements – Specific Information \(B.02.02\) record, the ICT service supply chain \(B.05.02\) is now updated automatically. If a Type of ICT services value is removed from a Specific Information record, the corresponding supply chain records for Rank 1 and higher ranks are also deleted automatically. Previously, Rank 1 supply chain records were generated when the Specific Information record was first created, but subsequent changes or removals did not propagate to the supply chain, requiring manual correction.

-   **[Duplicate contractual arrangements detected and warned in DORA Register of Information](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-drtp-reg-contract&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading the Digital Resilience Third-party Information Register application to version 22.3.1, duplicate records in the Contractual Arrangements – Specific Information \(B.02.02\) table are now detected and handled across three scenarios. When saving a contractual arrangement from the UI, a business rule checks eight composite key fields and blocks the save if a duplicate is found. During Excel upload, duplicate rows are rejected and logged to the upload error report. During CSV package download, duplicate rows in B.02.02 are flagged in the DORA request record's error log; duplicates are warned but not removed from the generated CSV.

-   **[Duplicate supply chain rows warned during DORA CSV package download](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-drtp-roi-packages&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading the Digital Resilience Third-party Information Register application to version 22.3.1, during CSV package download, duplicate rows in the ICT service supply chains \(B.05.02\) table are now detected and a warning is added to the request record. This applies to both Rank 1 supply chain records, which are auto-generated from Specific Information records, and higher-ranked records. Additionally, when the Storage of data field is set to No on a contractual arrangement, associated location field values are now cleared automatically.

-   **[Simplified third-party element process](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=tprm-workflow-in-workspace&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrading to version 22.0.1, third‑party elements are now linked to a single third party and can no longer be shared across third parties. Scoring rollups calculate results from element‑level assessments rather than entity records.


 -   **[ServiceNow product tiers](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ai-native-sku-overview&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

The ServiceNow AI Platform now brings you a new AI experience with three licensing tiers available:

    -   Foundation: AI basics to deliver insights
    -   Advanced: AI to boost productivity across relevant use cases
    -   Prime: Act autonomously with all AI assets and create your own
Depending on your entitlements, you will have access to certain application features, generative AI skills, agentic workflows, and AI agents.
