-   **[Recommended Actions - View the relevancy score of the AI search results](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=nba-use-ai-search&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

To enable this feature, you must enable the Show relevancy score for results check box in the Context form.

-   **[Recommended Actions – Limit the number of search results for more precise output](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=nba-use-ai-search&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Limit the number of search results \(Top N\) that appear in the AI search tab in the Recommended Actions context side panel. To configure top N search results, you must enable the Top N check box in the Context form and then define the Search Results Limit in the Search Application Configuration.

Filter search results corresponding to multiple sources in the AI search tab of the Recommended Actions contextual side panel. You can also filter the search results at the facet-level.

-   **[Recommended Actions – Track the AI search usage trends with the AI search analytics dashboard](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=nba-use-ai-search&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Track and analyze the AI search usage in Recommended Actions using the AI search analytics dashboard. The AI search events and actions performed by the agent are captured in the Search Events, Search Source Events, Search Signal Events, Search Result Event, and Search Result Event Action tables. This data is used in the AI search analytics dashboard.

-   **[Recommended Actions - Read-only access to TI solutions for the Resource Generator author role](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ra-csm-installed-components&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Access Task Intelligence \(TI\) solution definitions in read-only mode as a Resource Generator author \[sn\_nb\_action.resource\_generator\_author\] to configure recommendations with Machine Learning \(ML\) solutions from TI models. In other words, the sn\_ti\_admin.tia\_user role is added to the Resource Generator author role.

-   **[Recommended Actions - Filter search results across multiple sources on the Search page](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=nba-use-ai-search&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Filter search results corresponding to multiple sources on the Search page. You can also filter the search results at facet-level.

-   **[Recommended Actions - Optimize the Recommended Actions refresh behavior by excluding non-critical field updates](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ra-csm-contexts-create&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Exclude the non-critical fields from triggering a Recommended Actions refresh on the record pages by adding the non-critical fields to the **Exclude fields** field on a context record. In a child context, you can also include the field exclusions of the parent context. You can enhance a user’s UI experience when you prevent excessive UI updates and still ensure that relevant updates trigger as intended.

-   **[Recommended Actions - Trigger Refresh for Recommendations explicitly or based on UI events](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ra-csm-config-data-broker&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Trigger recommendations refresh in the Recommended Actions tab on the contextual side panel when a UI or back-end event update is made. This provides dynamic and more contextually relevant recommendations based on the outcome of UI and back-end events. To trigger a recommendations refresh:

    -   execute the ForceRefreshRecommendationsscript include for back-end events

Configure JSON-based context inputs in a context to populate accurate recommendations corresponding to dynamically changing contexts. You can conﬁgure parameters associated with the context table along with context table parameters. To support scenarios where a single workflow may leverage multiple active contexts simultaneously to generate recommendations. This uses the context inputs in rule condition builders, resource generators, and recommendation-action mappings, with minimal performance impact and backward compatibility.

-   **[Recommended Actions - Enhanced KB article sharing for Agents](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=ra-csm-guidances-attach-share-article&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Identify the Knowledge Base \(KB\) articles that are not accessible to the case requester with the help of a Lock icon. In the recommendations on the contextual side panel of the CSM Configurable Workspace, a Lock icon on a recommendation card denotes that the recommended KB article cannot be accessed by the case requester.

-   **[Process Mining - SLA breach analysis](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=csm-integration-po&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

Identify and analyze cases where service level agreements \(SLAs\) have been violated. The SLA breach analysis project provides insights into the root causes of breaches, highlights bottlenecks, and recommends improvements to optimize the performance of your processes.

-   **[Quick start tests for Customer Service Management](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=quick-start-tests-csm&family=zurich&ft:locale=en-US)**

After upgrades and deployments of new applications or integrations, run quick start tests to verify that Customer Service Management works as expected. If you customized Customer Service Management, copy the quick start tests and configure them for your customizations.
