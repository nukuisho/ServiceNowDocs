Yokohama

</td><td>

-   Upgrading to Yokohama may extend the upgrade maintenance time of a customer due to Appointment Booking. The Appointment Booking configuration tables get extended to the Application File \[sys\_metadata\] table as a part of the upgrade. After upgrading to Yokohama, re-parenting occurs automatically and the duration of the re-parenting depends on the number of records in Application File \[sys\_metadata\] table.
-   Effective March 1, 2025, Google has designated the Places API, Directions API, and Distance Matrix API as Legacy services. The newer versions of these services are Places API \(New\) and Routes API. You can’t enable or generate new API keys for these legacy services. However, you can continue using these services with the existing API keys. If you need to create a new Google API key after March 1, 2025, you must enable the new APIs from Google Console and upgrade to Yokohama Patch 3 version or higher to ensure compatibility.

The **Enable assignments only with preferred/secondary agents** constraint has been renamed to **Enable assignments based on technician assignment preference** and updated to restrict task assignment exclusively to technicians marked as required on the work order task. If no required technician is available or eligible, the task is dropped from optimization and logged in the run summary.

-   **[Access Control List Rules](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/access?context=access-control-rules&family=australia&ft:locale=en-US)**

Query range ACLs, which prevent unauthorized users from inferring sensitive data through repeated range-based queries, are now shipped by default. If you customized any of these ACLs in a previous release, your version remains active and the out-of-box ACL is set to inactive; otherwise, the default ACL replaces the previously generated one. The affected tables are:

    -   task\_rec\_m2m\_recommend\_policy\_criteria
    -   task\_rec\_recommendation\_applicability
    -   task\_rec\_recommendation\_criteria
    -   task\_rec\_recommendation\_policy
