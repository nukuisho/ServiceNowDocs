# About Playbook Experience

Interact with a business workflow in real time from within Workspace. Agents can use Playbook Experience to update records, upload attachments, and complete tasks across multiple workflow activities.

## Playbook Experience overview

Playbooks are built by admins in Workflow Studio, customized by admins in UI Builder and more, and embedded in Workspace, Configurable Workspace, Service Portal and more. The Playbook Experience for fulfillers during runtime provides visibility into cross-business workflows and the actionable tasks used to complete these business workflows.

-   Playbooks may appear in the side panel or in the related items of records configured with playbook.
-   Activities that you must perform to complete the business workflow are displayed. Some activities may be performed by an AI Agent instead. You're able to see what you of an AI Agent has done and what still must be done to complete the playbook. You can collapse activities to display relevant activities, and expand them again.
-   Activities are typically performed sequentially. You can go back to those activities to complete them later. Complete an activity and go to the next activity, or complete the playbook, as shown below. \[Omitted image "playbook-flow.gif"\] Alt text: Playbook flow example

## Playbook UI

Playbooks contain helpful UI features.

-   **Header**

    Shows the title of a Playbook. A header exists for each playbook attached to a record. Selecting a Playbook header expands the stages nested under it, as shown below.

-   **Stages**

    Click a stage title to view its activities. By default, all activity cards are collapsed except for the first card in a stage.

    The stage progress updates as activities are completed. A checkmark inside the playbook header indicates that the stage is complete.

    Use the stage filter \(\[Omitted image "playbook-hr-filter-icon.png"\] Alt text: Playbook filter icon\) to filter a playbook.

-   **Activity cards**

    Playbook activity cards display details about an activity, which may include the status, SLA timer, form data, and attachments. Use playbook activity cards to complete tasks by filling in forms, completing checklists, and adding attachments, as shown below.
