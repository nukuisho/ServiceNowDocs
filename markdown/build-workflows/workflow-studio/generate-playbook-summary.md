# Generate a playbook summary

Generate an AI-generated summary of the stages, activities, triggers, and inputs of a playbook from the Workflow Studio canvas.

## Before you begin

Verify that the Now Assist for Creator plugin is installed and the **Playbook Summarization** skill is active.

**Note:** Skills are available in **Admin** &gt; **Now Assist Admin** &gt; **Now Assist Skills** &gt; **Creator**. If you don't see **Creator** under **Now Assist Skills**, the plugin is not installed.

The playbook must have at least one stage and activity before a summary can be generated.

Role required: pd\_author

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Process Automation** &gt; **Workflow Studio**.

2.  Open the playbook for which you want to generate the summary.

3.  From the More Actions menu \( \[Omitted image "triggers-more-actions.png"\] Alt text:\), select **Summarize**.

4.  On the Playbook Summary panel, select **Summarize playbook**.

5.  Select a summary format: **Standard**, **Short**, or **Elaborate**.

    The summary is generated and displayed in the panel. The first paragraph provides a brief overview of the playbook, followed by a description of each stage.


## What to do next

After generating a summary, you can perform the following actions:

-   To refine the summary, use the **Refine** options to elaborate, shorten, or change the tone, or enter a custom instruction in the open prompt field.
-   To regenerate the summary after playbook changes, select **Refresh**. If the playbook structure has changed since the last summary was generated, a warning appears prompting you to refresh.
-   To copy the summary to the playbook description field, select **Set as description**, then select **Save and close**.
