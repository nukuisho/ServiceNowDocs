# Configure an event pull connector

Configure event pull connectors that require a script, connector definition, and connector instance to pull events from external management systems. These connectors automate the data retrieval process, promoting the seamless integration of external events into your system for efficient monitoring and management.

## Before you begin

Role required: TSOM Assurance admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **Workspaces** &gt; **Service Operations Workspace**.

2.  From the navigation pane, select the Integrations Launchpad icon \[Omitted image "integrations\_launchpad\_icon.png"\] Alt text:.

3.  Select the **Browse Integrations** tab

4.  Search for the external management system integration \(for example, Meraki, Fortinet, or VeloCloud\).

5.  Select the integration tile labeled **Metrics**.

6.  On the Connector Instance New record page, in the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the connector type.

7.  In the **Connector definition** field, select the type of integration you're setting up.

8.  In the **Description** field, enter brief information about this connector.

9.  In the **Assignment group** field, select the group or team responsible for managing and maintaining the connector.

10. In the **Host IP** field, enter the IP address or host name used to select the appropriate MID Server for communicating with the event source host.

11. In the **Credential** field, select the valid credentials to access the event source host.

12. In the **Metrics collection schedule \(seconds\)** field, enter the polling interval for metric collection.

    **Important:** For a CPU usage \(`devicePerformance`\) connector instance, the **Metrics collection schedule \(seconds\)** field must be set to 1800 or greater \(30 minutes minimum\). The system displays a validation error for lower values. For a Fortinet interface logs connector instance, the **Metrics collection schedule \(seconds\)** field must be set to 600 or less \(10 minutes maximum\). The system displays a validation error for higher values.

13. Validate the connectivity of the connector before activating it by selecting **Test Connector**.

14. Select **Update**.

15. Verify that the pull connector is configured correctly and events are flowing into the system by returning to the Integrations Launchpad.

    The tiles appear under the **Installed Integrations** tab.
