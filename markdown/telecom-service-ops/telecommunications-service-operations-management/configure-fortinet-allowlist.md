# Configure Fortinet allowlist

Configure connector definitions to limit polling to specific Fortinet ADOMs using allowlist settings.

## Before you begin

Role required: tsom\_visibility\_admin

## About this task

Use multiple connector instances with disjoint allowlists to distribute collection across MID Servers and avoid polling interval overruns in large-scale deployments. Specify the ADOM from which the connector pulls data.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Event Management** &gt; **Integrations** &gt; **Connector Definitions**.

2.  Search for `Fortinet` in the search field.

3.  Select the connector from the list, then the Connector Instance.

4.  In the **Connector Instance Values** section, specify the ADOM from which you want to receive metric data.

    The connector retrieves logs only for the specified ADOM.

5.  Select **Update**.


## Result

The connector applies these values at each polling cycle.
