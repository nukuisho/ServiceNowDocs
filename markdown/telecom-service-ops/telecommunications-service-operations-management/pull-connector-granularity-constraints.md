# Pull connector granularity constraints

Each connector type enforces minimum and maximum values for the granularity and metrics collection schedule fields on the connector instance form. The connector instance form rejects values outside the supported range.

|Connector|API / metric type|Field|Constraint|
|---------|-----------------|-----|----------|
|Meraki|All metrics|Granularity|Must be a valid value supported by the Meraki API|
|Uplink loss and latency|Granularity|Maximum 5 minutes|
|Device performance \(CPU usage\)|Metrics collection schedule|Minimum 30 minutes|
|Fortinet|Interface logs|Metrics collection schedule|Maximum 10 minutes|

## Field descriptions

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Granularity|Time resolution of each sample returned per API call. Controls how finely the source system data is sliced within a polling cycle.|
|Metrics collection schedule|Frequency at which the connector polls the source system API. Also referred to as the poller iteration window.|
