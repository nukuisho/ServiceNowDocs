# MPN latency KPIs

Reference for the latency KPIs collected by the MPN Pull Connector and the derived UE-to-switch latency metric.

## Source KPIs

The MPN Pull Connector collects the following latency KPIs from the `e2e-latency-collector-{env}` Elasticsearch index, filtered to round-trip-time samples \(`phase=rtt`\).

|KPI|Description|
|---|-----------|
|`collector2ue`|Latency between the collector and the user equipment \(UE\).|
|`collector2sw`|Latency between the collector and the switch.|

## Derived KPI

TSOM calculates one additional KPI from the source KPIs. This value is not reported directly by the vendor; it is computed after both source KPIs are collected.

|KPI|Description|
|---|-----------|
|`ue2sw`|User-equipment-to-switch latency, calculated as `collector2sw` minus `collector2ue`. If a switch-side record is missing for a given DNN in a collection cycle, the calculation is skipped for that cycle.|
