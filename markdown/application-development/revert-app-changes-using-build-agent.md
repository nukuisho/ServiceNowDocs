# Revert app changes with Build Agent

Restore your development to a previous state when you want to undo recent changes. Use checkpoints created during Build Agent conversations to revert both code and chat history.

## Before you begin

Role required: admin

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **App Development** &gt; **ServiceNow Studio**.

    You can also open Build Agent in the ServiceNow IDE if you prefer a more code-centric experience.

2.  Open Build Agent.

    **Note:** The Build Agent chat panel opens by default in new ServiceNow Studio sessions. If the panel isn't open, select **Open Build Agent** from the status bar in the corner of your browser.

3.  Open a previous chat to revert your changes by selecting the chats icon \[Omitted image "sn-studio-ba-chats-icon.png"\] Alt text:.
