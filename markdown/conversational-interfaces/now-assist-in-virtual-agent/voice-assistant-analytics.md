# Voice page in assistant analytics

Monitor the performance of voice assistants from the Voice page of Assistant analytics in Assistant Designer.

The Voice page shows performance metrics for your voice assistants, organised across four tabs: **Overview**, **Performance**, **Insights**, and **Assist consumption**. Use these tabs to monitor conversation volume, resolution rates, tool execution, authentication performance, conversation quality signals, and AI agent assist usage.

\[Omitted image "aiv-voice-assistant-analytics-dashboard.png"\] Alt text: Voice assistants analytics page in Assistant Designer showing the Overview tab with four sub-tabs, filters, and performance widgets including total conversations and resolution rate.

You can filter the data on all tabs using the following options:

-   Filter by voice assistant: View metrics for specific voice assistants.
-   Filter by language: View metrics by conversation language, such as English, German, Spanish, and so on.
-   Filter by communication channel type: View metrics by channel, such as phone, mobile app - iOS, mobile app - Android, or web browser.
-   Filter by date range: View metrics for a specific time period.

Scorecard widgets display a trend indicator below the metric value, showing the change in value compared to the equivalent previous period. The indicator includes the absolute change, the percentage change, and the comparison date range.

**Note:** Metrics marked with the **AI Inferred** tag are calculated through large language model \(LLM\) transcript analysis. Results may vary and may not be fully accurate. Review AI Inferred metrics before acting on them.
