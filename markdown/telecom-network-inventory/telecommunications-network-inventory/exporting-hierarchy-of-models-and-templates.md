# Exporting hierarchy of models and templates

Export equipment models, inventory templates, and related records to support development-to-production migration of network inventory data.

## Exporting hierarchy of models and templates

The Export Hierarchy feature lets you export network equipment models, inventory templates, and their related records from a ServiceNow instance, in a format suited to your purpose. Use this feature to promote validated configurations from a lower environment to production, to share model catalogs with partners or stakeholders, or to extract specific records for analysis.

|Your scenario|Use this method|
|-------------|---------------|
|You need to preserve the relationship records as a single package.|Exporting hierarchy via JSON|
|You need to export specific related records of a model or template in a chosen format. For example, exporting equipment data as CSV for analysis, as PDF for a stakeholder review, or as XML for selective re-import.|Exporting hierarchy via XML \(or other selected format\)|

Both methods are launched from the Export Hierarchy action on a model or template record. The method you use depends on whether you select Export Hierarchy directly from a record's context menu \(JSON method\) or use the related-records list \(XML or other-format method\).

|Role|Action performed on "Export Hierarchy" initiation|
|----|-------------------------------------------------|
|sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_admin|Generates a JSON file packaging the hierarchy|
|sn\_ni\_core.telco\_inventory\_catalog\_manager|Generates a JSON file packaging the hierarchy|
|sn\_ni\_core.inventory\_template\_manager|Generates a JSON file packaging the hierarchy|
|Platform admin \(no TNI roles\)|Shows the related-records list is export as XML. Multiple records are exported as one single XML.|
