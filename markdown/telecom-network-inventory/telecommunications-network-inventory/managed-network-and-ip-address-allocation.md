# Managed Network and IP address allocation

A Managed Network record defines a network scope that can be assigned to an IP Address Block. When assigned, the Managed Network propagates to every IP Subnetwork beneath that block.

## Propagation behavior

Propagation behavior depends on whether the parent block has a Managed Network assigned:

-   When the parent block has a Managed Network assigned, the subnetwork's Managed Network field is pre-populated with the parent's value and is read-only. The subnetwork cannot be assigned to a different Managed Network.
-   When you create an IP Subnetwork beneath an IP Address Block that has no Managed Network assigned, the subnetwork's Managed Network field is editable. You can leave it empty or assign it to any Managed Network. That choice propagates to any nested subnetworks beneath this subnetwork.

## Uniqueness scope

The Managed Network value defines the scope within which an IP Address Block’s CIDR must be unique. The same CIDR may exist in different Managed Networks.
