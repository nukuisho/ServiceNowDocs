# Create IP subnetwork function

The Create IP Subnetwork function enables you to create an IP subnetwork record in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application based on the input that you receive when you instantiate an inventory.

You can use this action as a flow designer action in the Telecommunications Network Inventory workflow. Here, either CIDR or, first IP and last IP, or first IP and total host are required inputs to create a subnetwork. If the parent IP pool is provided in input, then the function validates and ensures that the subnetwork that is being created is under the provided IP pool.

## Roles and availability

Users with the admin role can add an action to a flow and define the configuration details of the flow. This function is available as a Flow Designer action in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application so that you can perform inventory-related data operations.
