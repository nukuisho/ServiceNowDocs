# Allocate Free Number function

The Allocate Free Number function enables you to assign free numbers from the Telecommunications Network Inventory number record. You use this function to allocate a quantity of numbers from a specified range to add against the configuration item \(CI\) in a number element.

You use the Allocate Free Number function to do the following actions:

-   Assign the free number from a number range that is in the inventory record.
-   Get the free number from the number range and create the inventory number record as a child number.
-   Add the free numbers against the CI in a number element.

You can use this function as a Workflow Studio action in the Telecommunications Network Inventory workflow.

## Roles and availability

An admin role can add an action to a flow and define the configuration details of the flow. This function is available as a Workflow Studio action in the Telecommunications Network Inventory application so that you can perform inventory-related data operations.

## Output

The following table lists the information about the function output.

|Name|Description|Type|
|----|-----------|----|
|FinalRecordList|Returns the list of inventory number records for the number range.|Array.Integer|

## Example

Consider that a VLAN has 1–4096 as the number range and 1–1000, 1001–2500, and 2510–4096 are the subranges. If you give the count as 4, the function returns the list of inventory number records for 2501, 2502, 2503, and 2504. These numbers are free in the VLAN number range.
