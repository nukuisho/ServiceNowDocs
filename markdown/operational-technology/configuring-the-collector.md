# Configure the OT Discovery Collector

The OT Discovery Collector is an application that you can install on a Windows or Linux system.

## Collector Credentials

Depending on how you have deployed the Console, you may have to manually edit the hostname value in the `config.json` file to validate the Collector's credentials. If you install an offline Console or install into cloud environments, the `hostname` value may not be correct. For the OT Discovery Collector, the hostname needs to be set to the Console hosts external/network IP address. It is important to check this setting and adjust it as needed.

**Note:** If you want to download and install the Console and Collector containerized packages, see [Air-gapped networks and OT Discovery installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/operational-technology/air-gapped-networks-installation.md) for more information.
